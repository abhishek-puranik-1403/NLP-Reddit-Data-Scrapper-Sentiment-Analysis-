"PSA: H1B / COVID19 - no furlough, no unemployment benefits.",38,fwkh84,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/fwkh84/psa_h1b_covid19_no_furlough_no_unemployment/,0,"Very similar questions are being asked here and on /r/immigration. There is the excellent explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/frnlln/coronavirus_faq_stimulus_checks_visa_holders/.

Excerpt below:

**Q: I'm on a work visa and my hours were cut OR my pay was reduced OR placed on no-pay leave OR furloughed. Can I stay?**

For nearly all work visas, any reduction of your hours or pay is functionally **equivalent to a lay off**. The only exception is if your LCA or petition specified an hourly wage instead of an annual wage; in this a reduction of hours may be acceptable (though you should check with your company's lawyers).

You may have a 60 day grace period, and if you wish to stay, look at the next question.

**Q: I'm on a E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, and TN and got laid off - what can I do?**

You have a 60 day grace period before you have to depart.

You have a couple of options, and you MUST pick one before the end of the grace period:

* Depart the United States
* For most work visas (except L-1), you can find a new job and have your employer file an I-129. You cannot start work until it is approved (3-10 months), unless you're on the H-1B.
* Apply for adjustment of status (if eligible) through marriage or work.
* Apply for a change of status to B with form I-539. Once approved, you can change back to a work visa status again with the I-129.
* Apply for a change of status to F for a course of study.",1586294802.0

I got a family emergency and I am trying to go back to Spain ASAP. My h1b has been approved and I think my h1b start day is October 1 (not sure if it haz been pushed due to Trump’s EO).

I just want to make sure I am right about the following statements:

- I can leave the US but I will need to get the h1b stamp at the US embassy in Spain.
- All embassies are closed due to EO (at least Jan 2021).
- Therefore, if I leave the US I will have to wait in Spain for the embassy to reopen and then get an stamp appointment with them.
- Trump’s EO might be extended, which will make force to stay in Spain longer.

I read in the pinned post that if I am currently in the US, holds a valid non immigrant visa, my chances will not be affected by this executive order. I know I should’ve planned far ahead of April 2020, but given some personal reasons at the beginning of this year, and that I had not been working for more than three months at that time (hired mid Dec 2019), I felt intimidated in asking the company for a future H1B sponsorship since I was still a freshie there.

Here are the questions that I have so far after reading the executive order for a gazillion times:

(1) What are the chances that the non-profit organization that I am working for (urgent care for mental health issues) since Dec 2019 would submit an H1B application for me? I have an MPH degree, and my boss is advocating for HR to give me a promotion as an Administrative Coordinator soon. The person with that job title in the past also had an MPH, but it is not a requirement for the position. Nothing has really changed for me since the pandemic since our program was determined essential, but I have been supporting the clinic on our COVID 19 response.

(2) How do I know if the non-profit organization I work for is eligible for the cap-exempt or not, and how does DHS determine that? 

(3) What are the chances that I can successfully request for public health to be added into the list of qualifying STEM majors? I stumbled upon this article from DHS.gov that asks people to email the Student and Exchange Visitor Program to request an addition to the STEM Designated Degree Program List...but it was from May 2016. I’m not sure how relevant or effective this route may be. I emailed my department at my university weeks ago and they said they’ll get back to me once the International Student Affairs officer has an answer, but I haven’t heard back yet. I’ll be emailing them tomorrow.

Just wanted to get some second opinions on what my options are considering my situation right now

I'm in the US, working on my STEM OPT which is valid till May 2021. I got picked in last year's H-1B lottery and was due to travel to India (home) a few months ago to get stamping done but due to COVID everything got messed up. My company lawyers have asked me not to worry and have advised me that we will re-evaluate the plan of action in a month, depending on the situation. However, considering that they \*are\* my company's lawyers in the end, I wanted to get an idea of what my options are. The way I see it (and mostly what the lawyers agree with too), I have the following options:

1. If things reopen, I can go to India and get stamping done well before May 2021 (best case)
2. If things are okay but India itself is a risky destination to visit a neighboring country, probably Canada and get the stamping done (not a bad scenario)
3. If travel is not possible for the near future, I apply for a Change Of Status. Travel wouldn't be an issue here but the risk here is of it being a new petition and possibly attracting an RFE. In normal circumstances this would not be an issue since my role and company are pretty legit, with a history of successful and in fact nearly perfect attempts as far as H-1B goes. But given the current climate and weekly threats from You Know Who on immigration, this seems slightly worrying.

I guess what I'm asking is, have I missed out any other option or have I evaluated my current options wrongly?   


Also, my company's policies actually allow me to request Green Card petitioning now. Will this help in any way in terms of the immediate status? I know it makes sense to file anyway because there's nothing to lose and I intend to initiate this right away but is there any way where applying for it can be leveraged to lessen this risk of anything untoward happening by May 2021 (my STEM OPT expiration date)",1591953827.0

Argument with Lawyers over SOC Group for Data Scientist,0,gzb2pp,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/gzb2pp/argument_with_lawyers_over_soc_group_for_data/,2,"I am having a bit of a back and forth with my employer's paralegal who's preparing the LCA for my H1B this year. I am currently on initial OPT.

I have a bachelor's in Computer Science and Masters in Finance ( STEM ). I've worked as a software developer in the US before my masters. After my masters, I started working as a Data Scientist. My masters' i20 mentions my major to be 'Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods' (My college refers to this as Masters of Finance (STEM))

Now, the paralegal \*thinks\* that my roles and responsibilities align with 'Data Architect' as per:  
 [https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1199.06](https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1199.06)   
( **Education:** Most of these occupations require a four-year bachelor's degree, but some do not. )

While the duties mentioned on that link might align well, I am not comfortable with filing under that title because as an engineer I understand the distinction between the two clearly. In the event an RFE comes, which is very likely, I'll face a challenge. 

I researched on what SOC people usually use for Data Scientist positions and it seems like its this SOC :  
 [https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1111.00](https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1111.00)

( **Education:** Most of these occupations require graduate school. For example, they may require a master's degree, and some require a Ph.D., M.D., or J.D. (law degree). )

The paralegal's rationale is that the Data Science SOC requires Masters or PHD ( I am assuming she thinks that the Masters should be in data science), whereas the Database Architect SOC does not explicitly mention the need for the same. In any case, I strongly believe my masters is in a related field i.e  

""Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods **Description:** A general program that focuses on the application of statistical modeling, data warehousing, data mining, programming, forecasting and operations research techniques to the analysis of problems of business organization and performance. Includes instruction in optimization theory and mathematical techniques, data mining, data warehousing, stochastic and dynamic modeling, operations analysis, and the design and testing of prototype systems and evaluation models""

  
How should I proceed here? Does the paralegal have a valid point? How much of a difference does it make anyways?  


TL;DR  
Paralegal wants to file for Data Scientist position with SOC code for Database Architect, since the latter does not need a Masters or PHD. I have masters in Finance  (majors on i20 is Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods) and undergrad in Computer Science. Not comfortable to file as Database Architect ( dont want to lie ) Am I thinking too much? Does it matter?",1591688052.0

STEM OPT and Unemployment,1,gy4qyn,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/gy4qyn/stem_opt_and_unemployment/,2,"Technically, for initial OPT + STEM OPT, a person can be unemployed for a total duration of 150 days.

How are these 'unemployed' days counted or tracked!? 

Let's say the issue date on my EAD (initial) is 25th July. And lets say I report my employer details and title to the International Student Services at my academic institution on 31st July, while I actually started my job 15 July onwards. 

1) In the above scenario  am I considered unemployed for 6 days or 6 + 15 = 21 days? The latter obviously makes more sense, but just want to pick some brains here who might have a deeper knowledge.   


2) If I am a contractor, and I take a voluntary/involuntary  furlough for 30 days but join back after these 30 days. Do these 30 days get counted in the unemployed days?

The start date for the program is end of September. But this year I also miraculously got the H1b lottery and submitted an application last month.

I just got my H1b receipt, and so hopefully I'll have a result from H1b before school starts. Lately I've been feeling that going to a MBA might be the smarter move for my career now, but I know my future OPT might be at risk due to the government. That's why I wanted to hear your opinions:

* Can I get my H1b approval and then start school in September, but keep my H1b file as it is (for use after grad school)? Or is it needed that I start working in October for me to keep my H1b status?
* I know that switching my I-20 from my undergrad to grad school is an easy process. If I get my H1b acceptance, will my SEVIS status get affected so that getting an I-20 will be a more difficult endeavor? (Leaving the country to go to an embassy etc.)
* Irrelevant but do immigration officers checking our H1b applications survey our personal public social media channels? I've been posting a lot about the Black lives matter movement, and I don't want that to affect my application.
* Lastly do you agree with my game plan here:
   * H1b accepted before September - go to school if I can keep H1b, if not work this year and apply next year again
   * H1b denied before September - go to school
   * H1b RFE before September - this is a tough one, but I can wait for early-September for a full decision, if not attend school

What happens if H1B does not get approved in that time? When I resign from my current job does the process stop automatically and I won't have to worry?

If H1B does get approved by that time, I have two questions:

1. Would this affect my future H1B applications (if any)?
2. This is a long shot but I have heard that people can utilize there H1B time (once approved) later and won't have to go through the usual lottery process again. Could that happen in my case?",1590628229.0

So my wife applied to schools here and got accepted for Fall 2020 and got her I20.

1) Wait for travel restrictions to ease up and try to go to the home country to get the F1 Visa

2) Apply for a change of status from within the US to change from F2 to H4. Once that is approved she can attend school but can't work

3) Apply for a change of status from within the US to change from F2 to F1. Again I know this can take upwards of a year.

A. What if extension application is rejected before Client attorney files the response?

B. What if extension application is still pending and transfer application is approved ?

C. What if extension application is rejected after transfer application is approved? ( since transfer is premium, and extension is not)

Help! Advice - Company decision on EB3 & H1B,4,geavd7,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/geavd7/help_advice_company_decision_on_eb3_h1b/,10,"Hello! 

Please give some advice. I work for a company as a mechanical engineer for 2 years and one internship. I have one year left on my STEM OPT and one chance at H1B. The company wanted to sponsor me when they hired me, but later said no due to cost. Since I could not find another job, I stayed at the same company. I pretty much had given up on the process with them. I was just saving money to potentially emigrate to Canada next year. Recently, some key personnel left the company and I was put in a more must-have position. My boss started talking about sponsorship again since they are having a hard time finding someone to do our niche work. Anyway, I do not want to raise my expectations and be frustrated again, but I will at least do the best I can at my new position and hope for the best. 

Last time, the lawyer that we contacted proposed 4500 for the H1B (filling fees included) and 4600 (filing fees included) for the EB3, and the company also had to bring my salary up by 9 thousand to meet prevailing wage (they pay me kind of below market right, not super low, but low). 

I already spent 300 hundred dollars consulting lawyers on my own and I just wanted to know from you guys if these fees look reasonable or If I should keep looking for another lawyer. 

I told my boss that I would need EB3 and h1b filed at the same time since I only had a small chance to get h1b now. They could have me working from home country for a while while green card finishes processing. If I don’t get h1b. I’m also from a country that priority date is current. 

One of the questions raised was if company had to pay me the prevailing wage right away, or if they had some lead time. From my understanding, they only has to start paying the prevailing wage in October after h1b is approved? And for the EB3, maybe halfway the process? Or as soon as they start the application? 

Thank you all. I was giving up on the US after 7 years living here. Not a lot of hope on this, but it’s all I got. Please leave any advice you have.",1588758143.0

My boyfriend just got into Foster (University of Washington) to do an MBA. He would like to go, but we're in a bit of a pickle as I'm Canadian and currently can't work in the US, and we aren't currently looking to rush into a marriage.

I don't believe I'd qualify for the TN Visa, as I don't have credentials for any of the listed jobs (I'm a project manager at an education company). 

I'm trying to figure out how I could potentially make this work, and if so, what visa makes the most sense to try for. 

I'm hoping someone can help clarify the process of the H1B visa. From what I understand: 

\-You apply for jobs  
\-You get a job offer  
\-You let them know you want to be sponsored through the H1B visa  
\-They assemble your application   
\-You find out in April whether you've been selected in the lottery

I'm having a hard time understanding why any employer would hire a Canadian candidate through this VISA. For example, if I'm job searching in August, why would they want to hire a candidate who might not even be approved to come, and even if they can come, it's not until April? 

I'm quite desperate to find a solution here. If anyone has any advice for which Visas to investigate, or any helpful tips through this process, I'd really appreciate it. If anyone has successfully gotten the H1B visa (or another Visa aside from the TN), it would be so helpful to know what the timeline for the process was, and what steps you took to make it happen. 

I realize this isn't a small ask. I've been finding it really hard to find these answers online, but I know that reddit has the collective power of so many people! Any help or insight would be so so appreciated.

I know it has been an incredibly stressful time due to the uncertainties that COVID-19 has brought with it. I am posting this seeking advice in a delicate situation I have found myself in.

I am currently a final-year undergraduate on an F1 visa and have applied for my OPT EAD with mid-July start date. My employer filed for the H1B lottery and I was fortunate enough to get through. They were going to file my petition this cycle (Apr 1 - June 30.)

However, I've found myself in a difficult position academically; I'm on track to not get a passing grade in one of my classes that is a graduation requirement for one of my majors (I am a dual-major student.)

My two options are: 

1) Drop the second major to graduate in time, get issued a new I-20 (but that will affect the OPT EAD app I have sent out since it will have my old I-20.) This would mean I would have to re-apply to OPT, wait another 3 months without starting my job which wouldn't be ideal. 

2) Take a summer class (from mid June to early August) and still graduate with 2 majors. My OPT EAD, if approved, would arrive somewhere in mid June or July. I will accrue around 20 ""unemployment days"" but I can request to start at work 1 month later than my originally scheduled start date. 

I have already contacted my employer about this and waiting to hear back about what they say.

What will be the effect of this on my H1B application? I know my employer submitted some of my documents for the H1B lottery (they asked for letters from my academic advisors saying I will graduate in Spring 2020) and my I-20 with 2 majors as well. Can they add ""updated"" documents to the H1B petition that will be filed in the summer? 

What is the best course of action for me?

I understand that Consular Processing allows for more control over when the H1-B status kicks in, but am curious to know if there are other considerations to keep in mind given the COVID-19 pandemic. Does Consular Processing come with an increased risk of denial at the embassy/consulate or is it the obvious choice given the increased travel flexibility? Any other pros/cons that I'm missing?

EDIT: The one pro I see with Consular Processing is that if I travel outside the U.S. (before or after October), and if embassies are facing delays, I can choose not to get my H1-B stamped on that trip, and travel back on F-1. At-least that's my understanding.

To-clarify, the STEM extension will allow me to continue working on my OPT for 2 years, giving me that period to activate my H1-B if I choose Consular Processing.

Thank you!",1588317000.0

so there's something I don't understand about why Indians take the risk of taking up massive student loans to study in the US and then bet on the hope that they get H1B afterwards.

if I understand this correctly, H1B is only good for 3yrs and can be renewed and extended to maximum 6yrs. however, I've seen that Green Card waiting time for Indians are like 10yrs to 20yrs.

it means they will lose H1B status before even getting that green card even if they apply for a GC immediately after getting H1B. so it looks like they'll have to wait 6 yrs or more outside US.

meanwhile, the student loans can not be paid back in 6yrs time. I just read a news today with an Indian couple with accumulated loans of $520k. I mean that's insane!!

AC21 Extensions if PD is Current,3,g8kt3n,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/g8kt3n/ac21_extensions_if_pd_is_current/,3,"Can you get an AC21 extension if your PD is current?

I'm UAE-born (so ROW), but it currently looks like the ROW EB categories are getting backlogged like crazy. Just this January, EB-3 which had been current, was slapped with a 3-year backlog.

In the scenario that my employer does my PERM and I-140, and it takes a year, and in a year, there's a huge backlog, then my plan would be move to Canada, since I have no desire to wait for multiple years with few rights/freedom in the US for my PD to become current (because e.g. it's a huge risk to buy property or otherwise lay down roots in the US, while on the H-1B, etc).

My understanding is that despite having an approved I-140 you cannot use it (for AOS or EB IV) unless you are with the same employer and the same job/position. So a new employer would have to do your PERM and I-140 all over again from scratch. ***But***, most new employers would likely not be willing to do your PERM and I-140 without ""testing you"" by having you work for them for X period of time on the H-1B. Hence my question: *is one still eligible for an AC21 extension, once one's PD has become current*?

According to this Murthy article: [https://www.murthy.com/2003/09/15/h1b-visas-6-year-limit-portability-and-more/](https://www.murthy.com/2003/09/15/h1b-visas-6-year-limit-portability-and-more/):

>**One-Year H1B Extension Rule**  
>  
>The rule that allows for extensions beyond the six-year limitation in one-year increments requires the initial filing of an employment-based, permanent residence (“green card”) case at least 365 days prior to the start date requested in the H1B extension. This means that the first stage of the case must have been filed at least 365 days before the start date requested in the H1B extension which requests time beyond the standard maximum of six years. The first step in an employment-based green card case is usually the PERM labor certification. In those cases that do not require a labor certification, the I-140 petition is the first stage of eligibility for these extensions.  
>  
>**Three-Year H1B Extension Rule**

>The rule that allows for three-year extensions requires approval of the I-140 petition as well as requiring that an immigrant visa number is NOT available in the particular category. Visa number non-availability is determined by the U.S. Department of State [Visa Bulletin](https://www.murthy.com/visa-bulletin/), available through MurthyDotCom. Since the three-year rule requires non-availability of visa numbers, its applicability in any particular case is impacted by the employment-based (EB) category of the case, the country of chargeability, the case’s priority date,and the visa bulletin cutoff date.",1587958460.0

**The Rule Changes on January 17, 2017**

Among the avalanche of immigration rules changes that Obama made two days before he left office, were clarifications and C.F.R. amendments relating to the 6-year limit. Here's the federal register link to the relevant section: [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#p-685](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#p-685)

Here's one excerpt:

>In response to public comment, DHS is also providing several clarifications in the final rule. First, DHS has amended the regulatory text at [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(C) to more clearly provide that remaining H-1B time may be recaptured at any time before the foreign worker uses the full period of H-1B admission described in section 214(g)(4) of the INA. Second, DHS has made several edits to simplify and streamline the regulatory text at [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D), which describes eligibility for the “lengthy adjudication delay” exemption afforded by section 106(a) and (b) of AC21 to the general 6-year maximum period of H-1B admission. In particular, the final rule makes clear that to be eligible for this exemption, the individual must have had an application for labor certification or a Form I-140 petition filed on his or her behalf at least 365 days before the date the exemption would take effect. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D)(*1*), (*5*), and (*7*). The final rule further clarifies that an individual becomes ineligible for the lengthy adjudication delay exemption if he or she fails to apply for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa within 1 year of the date an immigrant visa is authorized for issuance. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D)(*10*). The final rule also clarifies that exemptions pursuant to section 106(a) of AC21 may only be made in 1-year increments. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D)(*2*).

And here is a more pertinent excerpt:

>I. RECAPTURE OF H-1B TIME  
>  
>*Comment.* A few commenters urged DHS to clarify that there is no “statute of limitations” on recapture. Some of these commenters noted that nothing in INA 214(g)(7) restricts USCIS from granting unused H-1B time when a recapture request is made more than 6 years after the initial grant of the H-1B petition. One commenter asked DHS to clarify that time spent inside the United States in another nonimmigrant status is “recapturable.” This commenter stated that the proposed regulatory text allows recapture only for time in which the foreign national was physically outside the United States.

>*Response.* In the final rule, DHS clarifies that, consistent with its existing policy, there is no time limitation on recapturing the remainder of the initial 6-year period of H-1B admission under INA 214(g)(4).\[[83](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#footnote-83-p82449)\] DHS notes, however, that the remainder of any time granted pursuant to an AC21 extension cannot be recaptured. The purpose of this clarification is to promote consistency and efficiency in recapture determinations in accordance with the policy objectives described in USCIS's December 5, 2006 policy memorandum from Michael Aytes outlining the recapture policy.\[[84](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#footnote-84-p82449)\]

This policy thus allows time spent inside the United States in any other nonimmigrant status (*i.e.,* any nonimmigrant status other than H-1B or L-1) to be “recapturable.” This final rule does not impose any additional limits on this policy. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(C).

H-1B extension dilemma,10,g3hfnw,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/g3hfnw/h1b_extension_dilemma/,9,"Hey everyone. My current H-1B period of first three years will end August 28th. I'm preparing to file my extension and am in a unique situation that I couldn't find any answers for. Hoping somebody here is able to provide insight.

My head office is located in A but my primary work location is B. I am at wage level 1 in B but level 2 in A. My attorney said I might get in trouble if I apply for the extension at level 1. Here are my questions:

* Does my wage level apply for my head office or primary work location? 
* Will my petition be denied for applying for level 1 extension? I did get an RFE for level 1 the first time I applied but my attorney's response was satisfactory and they approved my H-1B.
* If it is possible to move to my head office and continue work from there, should I do that? That way I will qualify for level 2 since my primary work location would be my head office.",1587212421.0

\- Do I need to close my USA bank accounts before I leave?

\- Do we need to update the Bank about status change?

\- I have paperless billing, however all Bank communications come to residential address. Do we need to update them that I no longer be staying in US? Can we provide an alternate address of Family/Friend? Or can we add a close relative and make it a joint account?

Long time lurker, first time poster here.

I’ve been in the US since December 2015 and my final 797 ends in Jan 2021. My visa stamp expired in August 2018.

My current employer was in the process of applying my I-140 and for that HR kept bugging me constantly to get my visa stamping done. So despite my better judgement I travelled to India in March and got my stamping done.

Then I got stuck here because of flights not flying.

Now the company is cutting costs and has asked me to accept a position in the India office and they *might* bring me back. I said I have rent and car payments in the US so I can’t do that. They said “tough luck”.

So currently I’m negotiating with them that they keep me on leave without pay until I can return so that I can find another job.

Do you guys think I have a case for wrongful termination here? My reasoning being that it was them who enticed me with I-140 application and a may 2020 deadline to get the stamping done and now they’re screwing me when I’m stuck here.

I have evidence that even in late January they were bugging me to go. I even verbally told HR that the virus might get me stuck there but they didn’t take it seriously.

Changes in H-1B Terms and Conditions of Employment,18,fxaape,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/fxaape/changes_in_h1b_terms_and_conditions_of_employment/,2,"  

Re: Changes in H-1B Terms and Conditions of Employment

Many employers have implemented sudden and previously unanticipated changes in the terms and conditions of H-1B (and E-3) employees. Some of those changes may be viewed to be “material” major changes requiring additional steps, while other changes may be less significant and not require additional steps. Decisions regarding these matters must be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting with the employer’s immigration attorney. 

H-1B and E-3 visa matters are supported by the Labor Condition Application (“LCA”) on Form ETA-9035, which must be certified (approved) by the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA confirms important aspects of the terms and conditions of employment including the job title, SOC/OES job classification code, worksite location(s), the prevailing wage (often a wage obtained through a DOL salary table for same/ similar positions) , and the “actual” wage paid to the sponsored employee. 

If an employer changes any aspect of what is promised in the LCA document, the safest and most conservative option would be to terminate the employee, or to obtain a new LCA and file a new petition with USCIS to accommodate the change whether material or not. There are some circumstances under which a new LCA and new petition are clearly required. There are also some circumstances under which a new LCA is not required, but a posting requirement may apply, and some circumstances under which the law may not be clear on what if any additional steps may or may not be required. In managing compliance efforts, some employers may be in the difficult position of how best to allocate scarce time and financial resources, and may not want or be able to take steps that are not clearly required. Other employers may choose to take additional steps out of an abundance of caution, even if not clearly required. 

The following Q&A may help to highlight some common scenarios, and possible alternatives. For each, a citation to a specific legal authority is included. Just as doctors must apply professional judgment in prescribing the correct medicine, in the correct dose, for the correct patient, immigration attorneys may recommend different courses of action for different employers and employees because even cases that may appear on the surface to be very similar, may not be exactly the same, and changing just one fact may change what is or is not a legally valid option. For any recommendation made, the attorney should be able to point to a specific source of law that supports the position. 

Q: My company closed its California office and is moving all of its H-1B employees to South Dakota. Is an “amended petition” required?

A: The employer is required to obtain a new LCA and file an amended I-129 petition with USCIS before moving the employee to the new work site. \[*Matter of Simeio Solutions, Inc.*, 26 I&N Dec. 542 (AAO 2015).\] 

Q: When is a new LCA required, and does that require the filing of a new petition with USCIS?

A: Material changes require a new LCA. These include moving the employee to a new work site outside the normal commuting distance of the original worksite, as well as material changes to the job duties outlined in the original petition. \[For example -- promoting an engineer to a completely different job category.\] Obtaining a new LCA also normally obligates the employer to take the additional step of filing of an updated I-129 petition with USCIS. \[See above. Also see: 20 CFR 655.715 for definition of “area of intended employment,” as well as “place of employment.”\]

Q: When is a new posting required, even if a new LCA is not required?

A: Moving the worksite to a new location within the normal commuting distance of the original worksite often requires a new posting, but not a new LCA. A common example is when a company moves to a new building in the same general metropolitan area. \[20 CFR 655.734\]

Q: Is working from home a new worksite, and does working from home trigger a new posting requirement?

A: Working from home (especially when home is within the normal commuting distance of the actual Company worksite) should not be viewed to be a different “worksite.” Instead, the employees are virtually accessing the actual worksite rather than doing so physically in person. The home should be deemed a “non-worksite” as the employee’s “regular work location” is the employer’s physical premises. In addition, there are administrative liaison notes confirming that the DOL does not expect telecommuting employees to post notices at home, unless home is not within the normal commuting distance of the physical worksite. It is also helpful to keep in mind that no U.S. worker applicant pool is being impacted or prejudiced by the employee working from home – especially if home is within normal commuting distance of the physical worksite. Note that WFH can be distinguished from the movement of a employer’s entire physical worksite, keeping in mind that moving the physical office could move the employer’s place of business into a different part of town with a new or expanded pool of U.S. workers who may benefit from the posting notice outlining the terms and conditions of a job sponsored by the employer. \[See: 20 CFR 655.715 for definition of “area of intended employment,” as well as “place of employment,” and “non-work site.”\]

Q: Is a new LCA or petition filing required if an employer lowers an employee’s salary?

A: It depends! It would not be permissible to lower the salary beyond the prevailing wage. The employer’s actual wage is subject to increase or decrease over time. Arguably, a reduction that did not go below the prevailing wage may be okay. \[See: 20 CFR 655.715 for definition of “required wage,” which is the higher of the “actual wage” that the employer pays for that role or the “prevailing wage” as determined by the applicable salary survey data. See also: 20 CFR 655.731(a)-(c).\] 

Q: Is it a violation for an employer to reduce a sponsored H-1B or E-3 employee’s hours?

A: This may depend on how the original LCA and petition were drafted. Does the change in hours move the employee from full time to part time? Was the original LCA drafted to note a wage based on hours worked, or a specific salary amount that will be paid monthly or yearly? How are the proposed new terms same or different from what is outlined in the certified LCA document? \[See: 20 CFR 655.731(a)-(c).\]

Q: What is the “short term placement” rule?

A: No new posting or LCA is required for a short term placement at a new worksite that was not anticpated at the time the original LCA was filed, as long as that placement does not exceed 30 days. This rule is often applied to a new physical worksite in a new metropolitan location, as may happen with a new short term project or assignment. \[20 CFR 655.735.\]",1586394309.0

Please advise.  
I'm an Indian citizen in my early 30s working in the US (H-1B visa). I came to India on vacation (when the virus had not spread at all) and was due to return to the US (California) in the last week of March, but my flight was cancelled due to the lockdown in India. I tried to leave before the lockdown but could not get on a flight back.

The lockdown in India ends on April 15th. When should I return to the US (considering both safety and possible travel restrictions imposed in the future)? My employer is allowing work from home and I have a valid visa stamp to reenter the US, so there should be no issues on that front.  
My background- I have been living in the US for over 5 years and my whole life is there. I studied there and worked very hard to reach this stage as I come from a middle class background.  
I am supporting my aged parents financially (both retired) who live in India, so my job in the US is very important.

H-1B Cap Lottery Update,22,ftq6kg,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/ftq6kg/h1b_cap_lottery_update/,0,"  

**H-1B Cap Lottery Update**

USCIS has completed the first round of its lottery process for assigning H-1B visa numbers this year. The H-1B petitions for person with “selected” numbers are now being prepared by employers and their attorneys, and will soon be finalized and filed with USCIS. That must happen before June 30, 2020. 

The requests filed on behalf of most others should still pending as “submitted,” but not yet “selected.” 

This is the first year that USCIS is using the electronic lottery process. Given the dramatic shifts happening in the U.S. economy for some employers at this time, it is possible that a number of “selected” visa numbers will not be used before the June 30 deadline. USCIS should then make those numbers available for the remaining pool of applicants who are still “registered” but have not yet been selected. In summary, the registrations that companies have submitted but which have not been assigned a number as of this date, may receive one later. For now persons hoping to obtain a number in a later round can only wait.

From October 1, USCIS will update the lottery web page to note “not selected” for any entries that are not assigned a number by that date. They have not done that yet because the lottery process is still continuing. The chance of receiving a number in going forward may be smaller, but this process will not be final until the new Federal Fiscal Year starts on October 1, 2020 (FY 2021).

As an additional note, please keep in mind that a “denied” notation indicates that the same employer attempted to submit more than one registration for the same foreign worker, which is not permitted. Thus, any registrations that did not yet receive a number and which have not been “denied,” should remain active in the continuing lottery process.",1585876265.0

I am currently on an H1B that expires in Jan 2023. This is an academic H1B, affiliated with University A, which is not subject to the annual cap. I am considering a move to University B. 

From what I understand, once university B files a petition for me and we receive the receipt notice, I can start working for them. Since premium processing has been suspended at this moment, it can take several months to process this petition. 

I am wondering if there is a way to hedge against the (low-probability) scenario where I start working for University B, and then after several months, the H1B petition gets denied for some reason.

University A is willing to give me a two-year leave of absence. I have two questions:

1. From the H1B perspective, am I allowed to work for University B while being on a leave of absence at University A? As in, does the leave of absence violate any condition of H1B?

2. In case the new petition from University B gets rejected, does that mean the old H1B affiliated to University A also get automatically cancelled? Or am I allowed to go back to University A and resume working there?

3. In case the new petition from University B gets approved, do I have to get my visa stamped again to reflect the change of employer? It's already stamped (with an expiry date of Jan 2023) with University A as the employer.

I looked around the internet forums and most people's typos I've seen from the previous years were about incorrect spelling in their names or wrong date of birth.

1) Can this error be fixed? If not, does this affect my employee's chances of getting H1B this year? I do realize that this year's H1B procedures have changed dramatically and so conventional wisdom may not apply to my case.

2) If it can be fixed, what are my options? I have not started filing for Form I-129 or the LCA yet. Does the typo have to be fixed before I start working on I-129 and the LCA?

Hope you're all staying healthy! Quick summary of my situation - OPT (already on STEM extension) expires May 31st. Last try for H1B, non-AD, PP (well, which is suspended I guess). I do have a job offer from a Canadian firm, and they're OK pushing my start date out. However, with borders being closed, even if I get my permit tomorrow, I can't go there.

2. I know we have overstay - 180 days without a penalty. Does that start after my OPT end date, or after my H1B rejection comes in?

EDIT:

As promised, checked in with international coordinator. Grace period of 60 days - starts the moment the OPT expires.

I spoke to the HR/Immigration at my workplace and they seemed to think it was because of my degree(I have an M.A. focusing in analytics). Regardless, they did not convey this to me or ask for any evidence from me to show how my degree was related to my position. 

I switched roles within the same parent company this year and during the time of offer acceptance I was told that the company would be applying for the H1B again this year. But I just found out yesterday that they are not going to do so because HR/immigration think my h1B will be denied again because of my degree and suggested that I enroll into a degree program if I want to reapply next year.

Next year is the last year I can apply before my STEM opt expires.  I have three questions:

1) Is the reason HR/Immigration giving me actually legit? 

2) Although I have been in the new role for 4 months, is it in my best interest to start looking for a new job at a more experienced(with immigration) company?

3) What alternatives should I consider if my h1b gets denied/not selected next year?

I traveled back to my hometown in India in January. During the visa stamping interview, I was given a 221g, and asked for an end client letter (additional documentation). When following up with my firm, I realized that my end client does not provide such letter (company policy). After researching online and working out with my firm, my attorney has provided me with a contract letter composed by my firm (not end client). This is the best they could do.

Tricky situation: simultaneous cap-exempt and cap-subject H1B petitions,0,f2jerd,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/f2jerd/tricky_situation_simultaneous_capexempt_and/,3,"Hi all,

The title says it all. I'm currently working for a cap-exempt employer, who is preparing to file for a H1B for me  in the coming months. I do not know when exactly they will file, but it has to be before July (that's when my current OPT expires. It's non-STEM, I cannot extend it).

However, there's another employer I previously interviewed with that wants to hire me this year. This employer is cap-subject. They sent me an email saying they're continuing to hire, and that they'd file an H1B for me if I was still interested.

My current employer is cap exempt, so there's less risk. I'm leaning toward the cap-subject employer because of better compensation and benefits, but there's still an element of chance.

My question is this: if the cap-exempt employer files first, and a H1b is granted, will the cap-subject employer still be able to file a petition for me? Or will the second petition be voided? If so, how do I work out the timings of these petitions? Obviously, I would like to keep both options open, but then again, I don't want to break some USCIS rule that I haven't heard of yet and lose both jobs.

Just so start off, this thought process recently dawned on me--I've done *some* research into US working visas, but I am definitely to be treated as a total 'beginner'. So forgive me if I'm repeating a thousand previously asked questions on this sub--feel free to downvote me if that's the case.

So to get to the point: I have had, since visiting back in 2016, a dream of moving across the pond (from Sweden) to work in the U.S. Coming from Sweden, and naturally quite fed up with the climate here, I'm dreaming of warmer pastures, namely California (preferably LA/SF), in maybe 2021-2022.

So about me: I completed my Master's in a field practically equal to Computer Science this past summer at the technical university in Sweden held in the highest regard (KTH). I'm currently holding a job as a software engineer at a startup-ish company in Stockholm, the capital, and I've also some previous international experience (thesis in Portugal and exchange semester in Tokyo). 

I guess what I'm trying to find out is whether I have any chance at all of obtaining a H1B visa, granted I keep my job/move on to a more senior position, in the coming 1-2 years? And if so, how would one go about finding an employer willing to sponsor the whole ordeal? Is the LinkedIn approach preferable for non-US citizens as well, or do you reckon there are alternate routes that are more suitable?

So I'm confused now. The previous page (which is on an official website) says you are ineligible if you have any refusals for a visa **after the most recent visa issuance**. However, the system you use to book an appointment asks if you have **ever** been refused. What's correct here?

(I don't want to answer ""No"" to ""have you ever been refused"", apply under IWP, and then get in deep water because of it.)

UPDATE: After you answer ""Yes"" the the question above, it asks you this question:

I'm a brazilian data engineer trying to getting a job in the US (CA or NY). I have already applied to a couple dozen different companies, both huge tech companies and also some well known startups (such as reddit). I chose companies that seem to sponsor a lot of h1bs for data and tech people in general (got numbers from the h1b visa sponsors database in order to figure that out). Also, I made sure to apply to job descriptions that matched my skill set.

However, I have recieved a few denials already, and none of the companies have contacted me so far. Given that all denials were for jobs I was qualified for (even overqualified in some cases), I'm starting to wonder.

How difficult is it to get a company, even a huge tech one, to consider sponsoring visas in the US? Could I be missing a few steps/qualifications in my job hunt?

Just to contextualize, besides the applications, I made sure to build a solid resume (not genius/specialist level though) and a LinkedIn profile to match it throughout the years. I assume having a hyped profession should also helps getting more attention.

Also, I made sure to start applying for jobs this month (January). Given the timeframe for submiting h1b petitions, it seemed to me like it was the best time for applying.

However, since the timeframe for the US visa stuff is kinda short, and since I get contacted by cool EU companies quite frequently, I'm seriously considering trying something in EU instead. Would still prefer the US (because of $), but if it is as hard as it seems, maybe I should focus my efforts elsewhere.

In the meantime, my employer offered me another position with more responsibilities in their European HQ and I decided to accept, mostly from a professional point of view (I am a EU national so it was easy for me to move back to Europe). It was agreed with my employer that they would not withdraw my H-1B application but that they were not going to spend any more money on it. 

I now recently received a RFE for specialty occupation with deadline to reply on the 9th of February. Both my bachelor and master degrees are in Physics, and I applied with the occupation title of Financial Analyst, so the link between the role and the degree is not straightforward. My job is actually in venture capital, and as it’s at the intersection between tech and finance, it is quite common for people in my field to have a STEM/Technical background. My relevant work experience is almost 3 years. 

The immigration lawyers would like me to pay $1,500 to draft the reply plus $2,000 or more for an expert letter supporting the reply to the RFE. I am now torn as to whether it’s worth paying the fees or not. ***How likely is it I would actually get the Visa? Would it be feasible for me to try to draft the reply myself or would that stand little chance?***

My reasons to have the visa are more an “insurance” in case I wanted to change job and move back to the US, but I haven’t decided yet if I want to move back. My current job could sponsor me for an L-1 but I don’t think this is probable as they want me to stay in Europe for now, and also that wouldn’t allow me to change job. My boyfriend, who moved with me to Europe, is a US citizen so that could also be an option down the line, but I would like to avoid as much as possible getting married for the sake of the VISA. 

I would welcome any of your feedback and ideas, as I have been really struggling to take a decision and time is running out now. Thank you so much for reading my rant!

So, I am interviewing with this company which is in my field of expertise and will probably get through it. Currently my H1B visa is approved but my current work is not at all related to my expertise on which I did my Masters degree in US. Having said that by God's grace my H1b was approved. 

Now I already planned my trip to India for getting my H1B stamped. I am aware that there will be an interview happening at the Embassy as well where they will check how well my studies are connected with my job.

There are 3 options that I have:

1. Should I wait for the offer with this new job, get H1B transferred, and get another H1B visa appointment and go to India. This will be the safest option but I will be wasting my money on the air tickets that I booked.

2. Just wait until H1B visa is stamped and then do the transfer process. This is better option but there might be a possibility that I might fail the interview at embassy.

3. Initiate transfer process and then go to India and do my H1B stamping done. This will be the best option. But I have lot of unknowns. Can I just travel with H1B transfer receipt to India in another 2 weeks ? Will there be multiple questions at the embassy on why I am transferring now?

IBM H-1B Petitions Hit Hard by Trump Administration Restrictions,2,dsy9nu,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/dsy9nu/ibm_h1b_petitions_hit_hard_by_trump/,5," More good news:

The Trump administration’s attempts to restrict the H-1B program have resulted in a skyrocketing denial rate among companies petitioning for the visa. But which tech companies are impacted the most? Based on data from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), it’s clear that IBM is taking a much bigger hit than tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel.

Denial rates for H-1B petitions have skyrocketed to 24 percent through the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, [according to the NFAP](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/H-1B-Denial-Rates-Analysis-of-FY-2019-Numbers.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-2019.pdf), which attributes the shift to tighter screening by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The agency sent companies additional Requests for Evidence (RFE) in 60 percent of cases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, for example, which is much higher than the traditional 20 percent “historical rate” for RFEs.

These denials hit two categories of H-1B petition: ‘initial employment,’ which means H-1B petitions for new employment, and ‘continuing employment,’ which is typically an extension for an existing employee. Let’s look at a company breakdown for the denial rate for H-1B petitions for initial employment:

What jumps out at you? As we pointed out in another article about this dataset, it’s clear that [H-1B denials are spiking](https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/30/h-1b-denials-spiking-contractor-services/) at subcontracting and business-services firms such as Cognizant. Meanwhile, the denial rate hasn’t risen nearly so much at traditional tech firms such as Google, Apple, and Amazon.

Now check out the company breakdown for the denial rate for H-1B petitions for continuing employment:

Obviously, it’s the same trend here. What’s interesting is that IBM’s skyrocketing denial rates are much more in line with that of a consulting company than a “traditional” tech firm. Of course, IBM offers consulting services in addition to its technology work ([such as quantum computing](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/11/02/ibm-challenges-a-recent-result-in-quantum-computing)), and it’s probably that part of its business that’s smashing headlong into the USCIS buzzsaw.

In addition to a more stringent review-and-denial process for H-1Bs, USCIS has engaged other policies that have slowed down the program over the past two years. The agency recently began asking companies [about the type of work](https://insights.dice.com/2019/07/23/h-1b-visa-companies-must-prove-work/?ads_kw=H-1B) that H-1B visa recipients will be doing, such as vendor agreements, subcontractors, and lists of projects; the heightened rate of RFEs has not only driven [a declining rate of visa approvals](https://insights.dice.com/2019/05/20/h-1b-visa-approvals-declining-despite-critics-claims/?ads_kw=H-1B), but also helped [spark](https://www.dice.com/jobs/q-Spark-jobs) dozens of corporate lawsuits [against the federal government](https://insights.dice.com/2019/03/06/consulting-outsourcing-suing-h-1b-visa/?ads_kw=outsourcing). 

### IBM and H-1B

The [H-1B Salary Database](https://h1bdata.info/), which indexes Labor Condition Application ([LCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application)) disclosure data from the [United States Department of Labor (DOL)](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis), gives us some additional insight into how much IBM pays its H-1B contractors. For this exercise, we isolated for the generic terms “software engineer” and “software developer,” as [our recent analysis](https://insights.dice.com/2019/08/29/ibm-microsoft-oracle-h-1b/?ads_kw=H-1B) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) [dataset](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) of H-1B visa applications for FY2019 found those were the most common terms for H-1B visa hires among tech companies (giving us a more comprehensive view of salary data).

With all that in mind, what did we find out? At IBM, the median salary for H-1B sponsored “software engineer” was $90,106 per year, although that number also varied greatly by city (as you might expect):

A sizable number of IBM’s H-1B applicants, of course, aren’t even reaching this salary stage. It will be interesting to see if the USCIS denial rate continues to rise over the next year.

I am worried that during my hypothetical F1 visa interview, I would get rejected because I have lived in America for so long they may suspect immigrant intent.

Denial rates for H-1B petitions have skyrocketed to 24 percent through the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, according to a new analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data. In other words, it seems the Trump administration is cracking down hard on companies petitioning for H-1B visas. But which companies are getting hammered the hardest?

“In the first three quarters of FY 2019, USCIS adjudicators denied 24 percent of H-1B petitions for ‘initial’ employment and 12 percent of H-1B petitions for ‘continuing’ employment,” [read the NFAP report (PDF)](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/H-1B-Denial-Rates-Analysis-of-FY-2019-Numbers.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-2019.pdf). “The 12 percent denial rate for continuing employment is also historically high—4 times higher than the denial rate of only 3 percent for H-1B petitions for continuing employment as recently as FY 2015.” (For those curious, ‘initial employment’ means H-1B petitions for new employment, whereas ‘continuing employment’ is typically an extension for an existing employee.)

As you might suspect, NFAP suggests that these heightened denial rates are directly connected to USCIS enforcing a tighter legal standard when it comes to these H-1B petitions. “USCIS has systematically rewritten the rules on H-1B visas, without following the law, and destroyed any sense of predictability in the system,” Jonathan Wasden, an attorney who files lawsuits against USCIS on behalf of employers, told the organization.",1572568355.0

This may be a very basic query but I unfortunately haven't been able to find a definitive answer anywhere. Most answers are ambiguous so please forgive me if this is too obvious or basic a question.

I'm an Indian with a STEM OPT that expires in May 2021. My employer filed for my H-1B this time and I got picked in the lottery. I'm waiting for the final approval to come through since we applied for the Consular Processing route. The questions I have are as follows:

1. Is this wait time normal? I've seen some colleagues get approvals over a month ago!
2. Regarding activation of my H-1B, is it true that I can actually get it activated at any point in the future to take maximum advantage of my STEM OPT? Essentially, once I get the final approval on my I129, can I simply wait till, say, Jan 2021 to get the visa stamped?

I was under the impression that no matter when I stamp it, the activation date of the H-1B visa is set in stone right away, rendering point 2 above moot, as in even if I stamp it in 2021, the clock on the first 3 years of my H-1B would've started ticking from, say, October of this year.

Essentially, I just want to do this: Maximize, if possible, the duration of stay available to me using both my STEM OPT and my H-1B (assuming I get approved lol) as much as possible, while also being able to travel freely and perhaps, just perhaps, take advantage of the fact that as long as I'm on STEM OPT, I pay slightly less taxes.",1571968428.0

I am a master's student graduating this semester and have an offer lined up for product manager at a well known Tech firm. I had a small dilemma for which I am receiving contradictory answers. This is an intern conversion so they had to come up with a new JOB advertisement for me to apply.

Degree: BE in CSE, Masters in information science (Data Science)

Problem: Even though my work requires deep technical knowledge and hands-on knowledge of advanced SQL, web development (HTML, CSS, Jscript) etc I find my job description written pretty vague and written in a hurry.

Moreover, my Job advertisement just doesn't mention anywhere that the job requires an engineering degree or any degree. So is there a need for me to let my managers know that they should edit the job ad or the issue is irrelevant and finally depends on what lawyers will write for my filing and i can work with my manager on the same.

Many people have suggested its all in lawyers hand and to work closely with them without being bothered about the job AD.

tl/dr: I-94 expires on 1/16/2020, USCIS may not decide on H1-B RFE until after this date. Do I need to leave the country before this date, in case they say no? (staying in the country after a no, and after I-94 expires immediately means illegal status from what I hear.)

I'm a Canadian Citizen working in the U.S. under an H1-B visa. My I-94 expires on Jan 16, 2020, and my firm has received an RFE for my first H1-B extension. Given the worst case scenario, where Envoy (my immigration team) sends out the Premium Processing RFE response close to the due date of 1/5/2020, there may not be enough time for the USCIS to approve or deny, before my I-94 expires.

 I hear that there is no grace period after your I-94 expires, even though you may stay up to 240 days until USCIS makes a decision.

Girlfriend's Student Visa is Expiring while H-1B Transfer is still Processing,5,d8ac7f,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/d8ac7f/girlfriends_student_visa_is_expiring_while_h1b/,6,"Hey all,

As the title says, my girl came to the US on a F1 Student Visa and that is expiring in December. At her previous employer she obtained her H-1B approval. Fast forward like 3 months and her company was bought by a larger company. From what I understand this forced the new employer to redo the entire thing. Apparently the ""amendment"" is to basically fill out all of the paperwork again, with updated employment info, and pay all of the legal fees again as well. They do that. Now fast forward another 3 months or so and we move from MA to NH because I was driving over an hour each way to get to work and she was working from home. This became an issue because she had only started working from home during the last 2 months or so, but her manager told her it was permanent from now on. We didn't think anything of it. AFTER we move we're told that the address on her H-1B paperwork listed her work's office (in MA) as the address of employment and that it couldn't be changed without (once again) paying like $5,000 to resubmit all of the paperwork. All of this to essentially change the address on a piece of paper. Long story short, they refile the paperwork to reflect our home address in NH as the work address.

Here is the current problem: Her F1 Student Visa is expiring and this last H-1B amendment has not yet been approved. The last we heard is that ""it's still processing"". Is she at risk of being deported? What is her official status once the F1 visa expires and the H-1B visa hasn't come back as approved?

Please note that when this whole process started we had no idea about any of this stuff. The laws and processes surrounding these visas are so complicated it's blows my mind. As an American I truly feel disgusted that we make the process this difficult. I have seen first hand how even the H-1B visa pretty much handcuffs you to your employer.

Applying to both grad school and H1b. Should I tell my employer that I want to go to grad school?,2,d5hmc6,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/d5hmc6/applying_to_both_grad_school_and_h1b_should_i/,3,"Hello,

I'm currently working in prop trading industry in Chicago under OPT. My H1b application this year was denied, but I have two more chances with STEM OPT.

I am planning on applying to masters in CS for career change. I would like to learn more about CS and go into tech industry, and also with lower probability of getting accepted as undergrad, I feel like I will be better off to just go to masters as soon as possible and apply in the masters pool. The problem is, most of masters results come out probably after H1b deadline.

Current work culture is a start-up like small team, and I have very good relationship with my employer and coworkers. I like the people, but I don't like the job. So, I wouldn't mind terribly if my H1b application is denied.

So here's the question.

Should I tell my employer that I want to go to grad school?

Should I tell my employer to not apply for H1b since I have already made up my mind to go to masters? Would that be considered rude? I just don't want them to waste $5000+ if I get accepted to grad school.

Has anyone been in my shoe? What did you end up doing?

Here's my situation: I've been on OPT for the last 3 years for a medical device company in SF Bay Area. My company sponsored my h1b this year and i got the approval (AD-RP) in August. This came is as both the I-797C and later a I-797A.  


Today i went to the DMV to apply for a REAL ID as well as renewal of driver license. Brought with me all document required: SSN, DL, Expired EAD, I-797A (valid til 2022), I-797C, I-20 (Cap gap til Sep 30). After reviewing the documents, the DMV representative told me that I am not eligible for a REALID until i receive a new EAD card for H1b, which i told them i won't be receiving, since H1b don't issue new EAD card. 

This got escalated to the field manager then Sacramento office. And they confirmed that i cannot apply for a REAL ID, according to the Federal guidelines, unless i leave the US and get the new VISA stamp.

I travel domestically around 5-10 times a year for both business purpose and leisure. Apparently  from 2020, you can stay in the US to work legally, but in order to travel you have to hog all your ppw to prove that you can do it ( Passport, I-797, I-94), which increase the risk of lost.

Is there anyone out there that have the same situation? Is there anything we can do to overcome this?

I currently live with my parents in the US under visa (h-4). I lived here for the last 10 years. now I'm in my second year at a state university(bachelors). Every couple years I see my parents go through same  stressful times. As they have to apply to extend their work permit visa (h1b visa), and its always stressful as it could get denied anytime. I'm thinking that's probably how it'll be for me the future as well if I decide to stay here. Since i'm from india, getting a green card will take around 20-30 years in the u.s (as per my knowledge).

so I was thinking that I should transfer to a Canadian university next year and finish my univeristy there. I wouldn't have to deal with the visa bs there as once get a job there, I can apply for permanent residency. and it'll be done in a year at max after I graduate asuuming I get a job there. So that's my dilemma should I stay here in the U.S., graduate from an American university and get a job and then deal with the same stuff my parents have been dealing with? the benefit is that I'll have way more job opportunities here with higher pay than in Canada. The con for going to canada is that, if I dont land a job after graduating, it will be tough situation for me.

How to reply to a specialty occupation RFE?,5,d284kd,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/d284kd/how_to_reply_to_a_specialty_occupation_rfe/,2,"A few weeks ago I received a RFE on my H1B petition. This is the first time that I apply, I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Engineering from a European university and I am being hired with the title ""Computer Systems Architect"" SOC 15-1199 - Computer Occupations All Other. We received a specialty occupation RFE because the documentation submitted by my employer did not detail my duties and how they relate to my title of study and that SOC code does not say that a bachelor's degree is required for that title. My employer is a small company and they are dealing themselves with the RFE. My assumption was that our attorney would write a response letter with the supporting documentation, but that does not seem to be the case. I think this is probably for economic reasons... 

Anyways, the employer asked for my help with this and I re-wrote the job description to list my duties in a more detailed way together with an estimated percentage of time that I will spend doing each of them. For the job duties I used the O\*NET as a reference. I have also written a letter that links the courses that I attended in school to the job duties and the experience required and how university gave me that knowledge and experience. I also suggested to my employer to get an expert letter even though I know they are not given a lot of consideration anymore. My employer will have a fellow founder in a similar industry write a letter and I reached out to a US university professor with industry knowledge to do the same. Is there a template that these letters should follow? What should they include to make my case very strong? 

What documentation or evidence is it really important to include in such RFE? 

I feel like my involvement in the RFE response will be key to get the approval because my employer is not experienced with RFEs at all (only 2nd time in 10 years that they apply for H1B)  and our attorney is not helping so any advice that you can give will be highly appreciated.",1568153789.0

**Prevailing Wage:** USCIS wants to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity for the same job. So, your Employer has to prove that the prevailing wage was paid to you (the employee) correctly.

**Job duties:** The job description mentioned in LCA has to match the job title in LCA. Say, for example, if your specialty job title is a generic QA manual tester, the burden of proof is on you to establish that it is a specialty job.

**Right to Control:** If you are working in a remote site away from your (employer or sponsoring entity), then USCIS requires your employer to prove that your daily tasks are being monitored on a daily basis.

**Employer-Employee relationship:** USCIS requires your employer to manage and monitor when you are working at End-client site and ensure that you perform your daily duties.

In essence, always be honest and comply with the system. That is the simple way to get your H1B process going.

I quit my Biomedical Science PhD and got a master degree. And I switched to Computer Science master and luckily got an offer from top-tier company before my graduation.

Can I add evidences to demonstrate I've almost graduated from computer science program, like transcript or courses?
2. If I'm rejected (say, around this October or November), can I ask my company to **re-file** another application immediately? But this time **re-file using my Computer Science** degree (because by then I would have already got my diploma)?

Marriage after H1-B denial,4,ckviv3,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/ckviv3/marriage_after_h1b_denial/,3,"Hi everyone,

So I just heard back from USCIS and my H1B was denied. My company is willing to submit an appeal, but in the meantime I would be leaving the country and staying abroad.

My girlfriend (US citizen) and I have been talking about getting married for a while now and planned on doing it next summer - now that my H1B is denied and I have to leave the country, we are considering getting married in the next few weeks. 

Based on what I've read so far, our case should be straight forward (she makes enough, I was never arrested - overstayed visa - worked illegally, history together, families know each other,...) but we are still worried that the fact we are getting married immediately after receiving the denial might raise a red flag, so I would like for your opinion. 

I did some research and it looks like these are the two options I have:

1. File the appeal and get married; stay in the US and be unemployed until I receive my EAD (looks like it would take 4-6 months?). *Downside here is that we'd be living on a single income*
2. Get married and leave the country. Work back home until the marriage gets processed and then come back to the US on a green card. *Downside here is that from my understanding it takes longer to process marriage paperwork when the spouse is not in the US, so we'd have to spend a longer time apart. However, she does have a good PTO policy and remote work at her current job, so there is a chance that she could visit me every few months for longer period of time.*

I read a lot about the h1b transfer process recently, where it's not a transfer, but the new employer basically files for a new petition. I have a doubt regarding this. From what I read, I understand that you can start working with the new company in two ways

1. on the receipt of the new h1b petition

I've only included *the letters themselves*. (Everything else contains private/sensitive information, so can't be shared.) And as far as I can see, in the letters themselves, the only personal information is my name and the petition number, which I'm fine with putting out there.

**A few notes/thoughts**

It took me a month to get a copy of these, so I didn't initially know all of the details behind the denial. (I'm thankful they finally agreed to send me copies of all these documents.) [**Meltzer Hellrung**](https://www.meltzerhellrung.com/) were the lawyers who handled my petition.

Compared to all of my previous jobs' petitions, this one was more thoroughly/extensively documented (when including the RFE response). But it seems like that was not sufficient to convince USCIS that a Software Engineer needs a CS degree. Unfortunately, the lawyers did not go as far as u/bostwickenator's lawyers did [in providing a detailed explanation of job duties and listing team members' degrees](https://old.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bdt5o8/rfe_for_level_4_wage_software_engineer_with_140k/el0iis0/), but is that level of documentation really necessary? All my previous jobs' petitions were approved with the less than the level of documentation that HyperScience provided.

It's possibly really based on who you get as your adjudicator. In the NYTimes article *""*[*Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/immigration-visa-h1b-trump-.html)*""*, the op-ed author (Frida Yu) says: *""My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner.""* — but that wasn't sufficient to convince USCIS that her job needed a degree. According to her article, she got **two** RFEs. So it seems like, in her case, providing profuse evidence only led to a **second** request for evidence. Her petition was probably actually doomed from the very start, based on who her adjudicator was.

I do wish though that the immigration lawyers had provided a more detailed/thorough explanation of my job duties in their response to the RFE. Maybe it would have made a difference. *Who knows?* There was also the fact that HyperScience has a massive contract with the an agency of the federal government — the Social Security Administration (SSA). I think it would've looked very impressive if they'd listed that they had such a huge revenue-generating contract. Also, if they had explained how HyperScience's work improves the lives of people who need [Social Security Disability Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance), maybe the adjudicator would have been less inclined to deny me — considering the significant positive social benefit that the work would provide for American society.

Regarding the point in the USCIS denial letter about HyperScience's office lease terminating on May 31, 2019 — they've now relocated to the 45th floor of the [**One World Trade Center**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center) (a.k.a. Freedom Tower). Dunno why the immigration lawyers didn't mention that the office was relocating to One World Trade Center in the RFE response. I'm sure it would have looked pretty impressive, if they'd done so. But then again, I don't know how this sort of thing is in any way relevant with regard to determining whether a job is a specialty occupation.

The lawyers didn't even expect to get an RFE. I had read online about an uptick in RFEs *for all H-1B petitions*, and I asked the lawyers early on, if they expected one. They said:

>We have not yet been notified of an RFE which is possible but unlikely in your case because of your offered role, degree type and salary. I would anticipate getting an approval by the end of next week at the latest.

After I noticed online (in the case tracker) that my case had gotten an RFE, I asked the lawyers about it, and they said:

>We already reached out to \[*... HR ...*\] as the only documents they requested have to do with HyperScience operations and not about your personal credentials. There is nothing we need on your end and \[*... HR ...*\] is already working on providing us with what is needed. There is no reason to be alarmed as the RFE is what we call a ""stall"" RFE where it seems the USCIS is trying to kick the can down the road regarding the premium processing 15 day clock. We should be able to respond very quickly and get an approval.

So really no one was expecting a denial. Neither the lawyers, nor anyone at HyperScience. Everyone was shocked and in disbelief about the denial.

It's possible that the requirements have changed, and that USCIS today expects an inordinate amount of evidence that shows that the job requires a bachelor's degree. But if such a change in requirements for I-129 petitions has been made, it certainly hasn't gone through [the federal rulemaking process](https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf) (established by the [APA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States))), and the CFR ([Code of Federal Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations)) has not been amended. As far as anyone knows, USCIS hasn't even issued a [Policy Memorandum](https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/policy-memoranda) (PM) about any change in the standard of evidence required for proving a position is a specialty occupation that requires a degree. It's clear that any internal change of requirements with regard to this has been made in violation of [the Administrative Procedures Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States)). But this isn't something new. If you read the news, you'll notice that several actions taken by this administration are being reversed by the courts *solely* for violating the Administrative Procedures Act ([one example](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/justice-roberts-light-rebuke-trumpian-dishonesty/592987/)). With the Constitution and statutory law being ignored and treated [with very little respect today](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/trump-doesnt-care-about-constitution/589654/), I'm not really sure where things are headed. In any case, HyperScience isn't really interested in pursuing my case further. They're not interested in refiling, nor in taking it to court. So there's the [matter of mootness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mootness) — and as a consequence, I can't do anything about this on my own. Refiling the petition was probably the best thing to do, but this whole ordeal was such a bad experience, that they didn't want to deal with it. I can empathize. If I were running a smallish company, and had this experience, I probably would never hire someone on a visa again. Which is probably *precisely* the goal of the people in power.

Anyway, I won't be posting about this anymore. Sorry that this turned into a long post.",1563176150.0

I recently got an offer from an organization with a history of employment sponsorship (not very recent) as well as history of willingness to sponsor (based on career fair data 2016).

My need for H1b sponsorship (or a transfer) has not been addressed in the interview process because I was advised not to disclose status until asked, also because I was too excited for the opportunity and hopeful for the possibility of things working out that it was hard for me to find the right opportunity to inform them.

Now that I have received an official offer letter, how do you guys advise I should navigate the process of revealing the need and asking for sponsorship?

I currently have an h1b with my current employer, but unfortunately the organization is dissolving and I'm being let go later this year. I have a Master's in social science, and this would probably be a cap-exempt to cap exempt transfer/sponsorship.

Any tips or suggestions would be helpful!!

Questions about H-1B administrative processing case number & what happens if I try to cancel my application?,2,ca9bct,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/ca9bct/questions_about_h1b_administrative_processing/,0,"Good day,

I am far enough along the very long H-1B (cap exempt) process that I went to the visa interview and am now on the ""Administrative Processing"" train (this is **not** the same as an RFE during the initial petition process), and have been asked to submit supporting documents. In the meantime, they have confiscated my passport... Two questions about this:

1. The case number I got for my administrative processing looks like ""2019 xxx xxx 001"", and it was *hand-written* to me by the consular officer. This number *does not* work when I try to check my case status at the [CEAC website](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker). I know that I can also use my DS-160 confirmation number there, but my point is that my administrative processing case number appears to be invalid?!?! However, if you look closely after selecting the non-immigrant visa type at [CEAC](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker), it gives you an example case number that looks like ""2012118 345 0001"", which is surprisingly similar to mine. The main difference is that the example ends in ""0001"" instead of ""001"" like mine. **So**, I tried to change the final digits of my case number to ""0001"" and the CEAC webpage was able to find a case status for that number!!! **So my question is:** Does the administrative processing case number always end with ""0001""? If so, can I be certain that perhaps the consular officer simply missed that extra ""0"" when writing down my case number? If so, when I submit my documents for administrative processing, I will simply add that extra ""0"" so mine would read ""2019 xxx xxx 0001"", *instead of* ""2019 xxx xxx 001"". Can anyone confirm if it is indeed true that the case number always follows the format ""201x xxx xxx 0001""???

2. I was told by the US consulate that the administrative processing might take 30 to 180 days or more!!! Right now there is a possibility that I might get another good job offer in another country (not the US) during this time period. If I want to take up that other job, is there a way to *cancel* my administrative processing so that I can get my passport back to take up the other job? If I do cancel my administrative processing (and, by extension, my H-1B visa application), are there serious adverse consequences for any possible future travel to the US?

Thank you very much!",1562548995.0

Is it typically set it around 3 year from the approval date, or is it added to the remainder of the current I94?

Denial by USCIS for $140k Salary Software Engineer Full-time Position (at a real product company; not a consulting/EVM/contracting company),91,buesue,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/buesue/denial_by_uscis_for_140k_salary_software_engineer/,76,"My new job's H-1B visa petition was denied by USCIS ([rfe post](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bdt5o8/rfe_for_level_4_wage_software_engineer_with_140k/)). They essentially said that they were not convinced my new job requires a college degree. This was really surprising and shocking, because my job was not low-paid, and was not with a consulting/outsourcing company. There were many news reports that USCIS was targeting and trying to get rid of people with lower-paying jobs (anything below $100k, or Level 1). The immigration attorneys who prepared my new job's petition had heard the same and didn't expect USCIS to deny my job since it was quite highly-paid. But it seems like the hatred of immigrants has grown so large that they now want to force even well-qualified highly-paid people (who are on visas) out.

My visa sponsoring company's name is [**HyperScience**](https://hyperscience.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in CS from a well-ranked American university. HyperScience is a VC-backed startup that's growing rapidly; and it's a product company, and not a consulting agency ***in any sense***. There are [only two other people](https://www.uscis.gov/h-1b-data-hub?topic_id=Hyper+Labs&state=All&city=&zip=&fy=All&naics=All) on the H-1B visa at HyperScience, so it's not ""*H-1B dependent*"" either. On the Labor Condition Application ([LCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application)), my job was listed with the *SOC Code* [*15-1132*](https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1132.00) *""Software Developers, Applications""*, [for which the Level 4 wage is $138,861 per year](https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?code=15-1132&area=35614&year=19&source=1), **which my base salary of $140,000 exceeds**. ([Here's the official U.S. Department of Labor website link](https://lcr-pjr.doleta.gov/index.cfm?event=ehLCJRExternal.dspCert&doc_id=3&visa_class_id=1&id=6770024) to the LCA that HyperScience filed for me: you can see under section F., a. (which is collapsed by default) that my wage level is marked as ""**IV**"", and my base salary is listed as $140,000.) Beyond the base salary, HyperScience offered other forms of compensation like $60,000 of stock options, $8,400 of 401k match, $2,000 in a [HRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Reimbursement_Account), full zero-premium zero-deductible medical/dental/vision with Aetna + [onemedical](https://www.onemedical.com/), free lunch everyday (through [served by stadium](https://servedbystadium.com/)), free gym membership, etc. Regarding the stock options: I have very high confidence that they'll be successful and grow significantly. If they grow 50%, the stock options are worth $30,000; if they grow 200%, it's worth $120,000. The 401k match, free lunch, etc is conservatively worth at least $15k. So my total compensation is *conservatively* **at least $185,000**.  It's also one of those rare companies with *30 days* *of* *paid time-off* – that's 6 weeks of vacation, on top of federal holidays. They also offered 6 months of ***paid*** parental leave (for any gender). It's rare for any company to be this family-friendly, but it's one of HyperScience's core values — [***see this blog post by the CEO***](https://www.hyperscience.com/blogs/family-values-our-benefits). *All of that is to say*: **I'm not underpaid**.

Besides the core assertion that they were not convinced my job requires a college degree, two other reasons that USCIS gave for the H-1B denial were: first, my job duties was not related to a ""specific project"", and so they were unable to determine if my job has ""*specialty occupation*"" work; and second, a job posting for my position on the HyperScience website did not list a degree (or other educational) requirements. For those wondering what ""*specialty occupation*"" is — it just means a job that requires a bachelor's degree at a minimum. USCIS 's essential claimed was that my job (of *Software Engineer*) does not need a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The spiel about that my ""job duties were not related to a specific project"" is nonsensical, because HyperScience is not a consulting/EVM company. They were ***clearly being disingenuous*** *on purpose*, since they went through the trouble of googling HyperScience, and they likely knew very well that HyperScience is not a consulting company. But they decided to act disingenuous. And, **denying** because ""*it could not be determined*"" is just malignant. HyperScience's immigration lawyers ([**Meltzer Hellrung**](https://www.meltzerhellrung.com/)) said that **the second point was unprecedented**. It's pretty common these days for tech jobs to not mention a degree as an absolute requirement. It seems like the USCIS adjudicating officer was actually malevolently  and impishly hunting for *excuses to deny*. In a diligent prejudiced search for reasons to deny, the USCIS official went on Google, typed in ""HyperScience"", found the [HyperScience Careers](https://www.hyperscience.com/locations/new-york-usa.php) page, and then found  [this job posting](https://jobs.lever.co/hyperscience/aea3d646-5706-4a7a-806c-c78eac2920f2), which matches my title of ""*Software Engineer - Frontend / Fullstack*"" (as listed in the LCA). The job posting unfortunately does not list a bachelor's degree as a necessary qualification. Many tech companies don't. The USCIS official then diabolically ***used*** ***this*** *as a reason to deny*. HyperScience nor its immigration lawyers were expecting them to find a random job posting online, and weaponize it. It's honestly quite unbelievable. It seems like the goal of USCIS today is to just get rid of as many people as possible.

I'm not the one of those underpaid H-1B visa holders that immigrant-haters are always screaming about. I'm well-paid. My work would have improved the lives of Americans with disability in a significant way. (HyperScience is helping the Social Security Administration significantly reduce the processing time for [Disability Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance) applications by automating various aspects of it.)  It's hard to find a job where you can have a positive social impact *in such a direct and tangible way as this*. USCIS denying my H-1B petition actually hurts the [millions of Americans](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table6c7.html) who apply for disability insurance each year. (Helping disabled people get ""on welfare"" is probably the last thing that Republicans care about though.) I came across an article on the NYTimes a while back called [Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/immigration-visa-h1b-trump-.html) — here's a quote from it:

>Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied \[...\]  
>  
>My two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a “specialty occupation” — that is, work that only someone with a bachelor’s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn’t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.

If someone that qualified can get denied, then it's no surprise they want to force me out of the U.S. as well. There obviously is a fair number of people at USCIS who just maliciously *hate immigrants from the depths of their hearts*, and whose daily joy is frivolously denying petitions. They probably laugh with glee every time they ruin the life of well-qualified people who have contributed positively to the U.S. economy for years (or who will do so). They just hate immigrants. ***UPDATE:*** [***See full copies of the letters here***](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/cd9y14/rfe_and_denial_letters_meltzer_hellrung/)***.*** *Here are a few relevant excerpts:*

&#x200B;

I am currently a full time engineer and considering a contract role that pays quite a bit higher (\~50%). As far as I understand there is no vendor, it's the employer (IT solutions company) hiring me out to the client directly.

&#x200B;

1) My current H1 is valid till Oct 2021. I have a visa stamp with my current employer in my full time position. The contracting company has offered a 1 year contract from 6/15/2019 to 6/15/2020. If I take it and file for the H1 transfer, would this mean my H1/i94/stamp validity automatically ends 6/15/2020, and not 10/2021? In other words, is my H1 visa in effect cut short by going from full time to a 1 year contract?

2) There is also a mention of a mandatory furlough period in the contract. Is this legal for H1B employees, ie forced unpaid vacation? Is there any way I can argue against this?

1. If my package was too late for the lottery, USCIS should have returned my package by now;
2. The H1B petition cap for master degree participants was not met in the first couple of days after April 1st, and that's why they might still accept late petitions.

1. If the package is returned (meaning not even entering the lottery), should I really have known it by now? I'm assuming it'll be fairly quick from USCIS simply because they don't accept the package?

There is the option on getting a L1B with my current (German) employer, who is active in the US in several locations, but I am kind of intrigued about trying something entirely different and applying at a different US-based employer, that would require H1B sponsoring.

Am I right that the selection essentially boils down to a single time of the year (beginning of April) at which applications are processed, the visa cap is exceeded, and the window closes again for another year?

Does this mean that - even if I found a company that was willing to sponsor my H1B right away - I would not be able to start working before Autumn 2020?

Leaving US soon with extn pending,3,bfqe1s,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bfqe1s/leaving_us_soon_with_extn_pending/,7,"I'm at the point of I 140 + 180, it took a long time to even get here, but my h1 extn (regular) is pending, don't expect an RFE (work in EVC model but filed with all documentation, paid well above the required wage level 4) but case transferred from Nebraska to Texas(!) recently.

Is it even worth waiting for the approval? I fully intend to come back after 2-3 yrs preferably for the same employer if they allow me to.

I see that USCIS will consider my extension abandoned if I leave the country now and my employer also will immediately notify USCIS that I left the job.

But I'm wondering if there's any addiitonal benefit in waiting for the approval (likely will be for 3 years) or if there's any problem in future in leaving early: if there's an RFE, or if there'd be a question (during future H1 or I 485 filing) to show my I 94 for this period when the extn has been pending.

I'm planning to leave as soon as I can for personal reasons even if I receive a full 3 year approval.

My I 94 with the current employer (H1 transfer) expired in Feb 2019, a previous I 94 from the last empoyer is valid until Jan 2020 (don't thibk it matters).

Although I'm nowhere close to the 240 day limit, wondering if waiting for the approval and then leaving will provide any help. Expecting approval in the next 3-4 weeks, if not earlier, based on other similar cases.

Also, if it isn't obvious already, my priority date is messed up by the per-country like a lot of people here.",1555891780.0

Company A is concerned about the h1b fees that it had paid for me. I have not received a petition number from USCIS/lawyer yet. Does it mean that my petition has not been processed ?

H1b experience of 2018,13,bdkrkg,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bdkrkg/h1b_experience_of_2018/,4,"Hi there, I want to share my story of getting H1b in 2018. Short disclaimer: I still did not get it.

&#x200B;

So, a large Silicon Valley-based (California) company submitted my documents through Fragomen in April 2018. Originally we expected that I will be able to start in October-November. Here is how it went further.

&#x200B;

\- February 2018 - USCIS postponed premium processing until February 2019. No 2-week case processing for anyone, it meant.

\- April 5th-ish there was a lottery. No notification followed, of cause. You have to wait for USCIS to cash your check later in May or, worse, send you a ""no luck"" message sometime in August.

\- May 20th-ish there was a notification from Fragomen saying, that USCIS took the money from the check and, therefore, I have been selected for the processing in the lottery. Hooray!

Now the tough part. From May 2018 I did not get any info or any input from USCIS and/or Fragomen and/or employer. Everything went stale and the status of my application on the USCIS website turned to ""Awaiting processing"" for, what it seemed, forever. Months passed and nothing have been changing. At all. 

There are 2 processing centers in the US. California and Nebraska. If you check the waiting time for your visa at USCIS website it will show you ""how long people that are being processed right now have waited on average"" - it is not indicative of how long you have to wait. Back in may it stated 7.5-10 month of wait time. I stayed optimistic. Optimism did not work out. It took really-really long. There is a possible reason: with the new US administration there were new regulations regarding ""on-site visits"" for h1b employers, which basically meant ""longer processing time due to more thorough procedure"". My case changed status to ""under review"" only in February.

\- Mid-February 2019. RFC request.

\- End-February 2019. Approval notice

\- April 2019. Earliest Embassy appointment. I got an administrative processing procedure, which imposes another couple months delay. So, I am still on hold.

&#x200B;

Things I did right and things I wish I have done during my H1b waiting time:

\- You will have no less than a couple of months after the approval, so you can have/hold a job, plan vacations and live your life to the fullest as nothing is happening until you get the actual approval

\- On the day you receive your approval fill in your DS-160 and make an embassy appointment, it might save you some time.

\- Change your passport once you know you are selected for the program (after May it is). It would be better to travel with a renewed passport and not having to come back to your home country 2-3 years later.

\- Use this website to check trends with processing application: [http://worktheme.com/trends.html](http://worktheme.com/trends.html) You can figure out your approval date and number of your applications through your approval number and use that to get an idea how much longer it would take for your application to get processed.

\- Prepare your employer and your future colleagues for a long wait.

\- Write a post about your H1b experience.",1555387584.0

I was just accepted for a new job with a cap-exempt American employer who is preparing to start the H-1B petition process (and related paperwork) for me.

One of my qualifications is a British (UK) PhD which is required for the job. However, my UK university will not issue my PhD diploma until this summer, but my employer wants to start the process now. Here are the interim PhD qualification documents I have now:

(1) An official transcript that states the PhD degree I am receiving. But since UK PhD programmes *do not involve any coursework* (you only do research), there are literally no courses/grades listed on this transcript and it looks pretty empty.

(2) An official letter from the university saying that I have completed the PhD programme and will receive my diploma in summer 2019.

(3) I have received an American-based third party academic equivalency verification plus an EDGE (Electronic Database for Global Education) certification stating that my UK PhD is the equivalent of a PhD in the same field in the United States.

Despite the above, my employer has raised significant concerns about my (a) lack of a diploma, and (b) lack of courses listed in the transcript. They are afraid that my H-1B application will be rejected because of (a) and (b).

For those of you in the know (or those who have applied for H-1B with a British PhD), is it very likely that I will be rejected? Is there any other information I can possibly provide or ask my university to provide? Thank you in advance for your help!",1554017008.0

The reason I want to quit A before I hear back from USCIS is that after I leave A, I want to take a couple weeks (domestic) vacation before I start the new job. If I waited until USCIS made a decision, then I’d have to ask B for a vacation right when I start — not ideal.

Doing this means I’ll potentially be unemployed for a couple weeks before I start the new job. I’m not sure if that means I’m out of status.

Any thoughts?

I know many people do not have good experiences with their firms, but try and keep in mind when you’re requesting premium processing from your attorney that this is a very stressful time for us as we feel USCIS strategically opened up premium processing again so close to the H-1B lottery to hamper our efforts with the Cap. They know that Cap is a very intense time for firms and now we have to go back to all the Cap cases we already drafted and redraft some of the forms for premium processing or do premium processing upgrades for already pending cases. I am very happy for everyone whose cases will now be adjudicated sooner because it is such a long wait, just hoping to give a perspective of what it’s like inside the firm.

Girlfriend (on H1B) & I are moving but we need an amendment? Please help.,5,azv5v1,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/azv5v1/girlfriend_on_h1b_i_are_moving_but_we_need_an/,4,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

First off, thank you in advance for anyone who is able to assist. The fact that anyone would take time out of their day to help a stranger is always something to appreciate. 

I've been with my girlfriend for a little over 3 years now and we met in Montgomery, AL while she was finishing her Masters degree. After graduating she immediately started looking for a job and ended up moving to TX to work for a consulting agency that turned out to be fraudulent (they wanted to lie on her resume and say she had 8 years work experience, etc.). She flew back to AL when I told her to leave & moved back in with me. I called the CEO of that agency and told him to reimburse us the flight tickets or I'd report him to the BBB. He paid us. Now the clock was ticking because of the time wasted with the consulting agency and after wanted seemed like hundreds of applications, she got a job in MA. I packed all our stuff in a trailer and we headed to MA. This is where  we live currently. Bear with me.

That company that hired her in MA filed for her H1B and it was approved. In the middle of it's approval the CEO sold the company to another larger company. Now some time of transfer had to take place. The new company agreed to process the transfer (or whatever had to be done) and they submitted whatever paperwork was needed. The problem is I took a job in NH (1 hour away) and she, my girlfriend, was granted permission to work from home around the same time. Our lease is ending this month, March 25th and we plan to move to NH so my drive is not so bad. Her companies immigration department is now telling her this would require them to re-file everything they just filed since she is moving to a different \*MCP or something\* (different area, basically). 

My questions are: Is this going to cost her company more money? Can we still move and handle all of this from our new apartment? What are the consequences if we move and someone checks on her and finds out she has moved? What if we get married soon, is any of this still relevant?

As you guys can see I'm so lost and so is she. Her company's immigration team is very short with her in emails and does not seem very friendly. Dealing with her visa situation has been very stressful for us both. If anyone could point us to a solid immigration lawyer who could help us (and hopefully not bankrupt us) it would be greatly appreciated. If I've left anything out I will reply with whatever info you need. Also, I may have worded something incorrectly and would be happy to clarify. Thanks all.

2. When I turn 21 and don’t have my green card, will I have to switch over to student visa, and what are my chances of getting it?
3. Once I graduate college what steps can I take in order to retain my visa as my end goal is to stay in US with my family.
4. My dad says that majoring in computer science will be the only way I will land a visa after college, is this true?

Thanks and I really appreciate your help. I feel completely lost and helpless at this stage as I know no one under h1b visa go through high school.",1547943769.0

Trump to H-1B visa holders: 'Path to citizenship' could be coming soon,15,aexw3x,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/aexw3x/trump_to_h1b_visa_holders_path_to_citizenship/,16," 

[President Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) on Friday indicated plans to change policies for visa holders, tweeting that a ""path to citizenship"" for H-1B holders was potentially possible under his administration.

In a tweet posted as the president returned from his trip the day before to the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump declared that the U.S. desires to see ""talented and highly skilled people"" immigrate to the U.S. and pursue careers.

""H1-B \[sic\] holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,"" Trump said.

""We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.,"" he continued.

 

The H-1B system, which allows U.S. companies to hire temporary foreign workers to fill needs not met by the U.S. workforce, is not intended as a permanent path to citizenship for immigrants coming to the United States.

Immigration reform has been a centerpiece of the Trump administration.

The president has battled Democrats in Congress for weeks over his proposed border wall. He has demanded $5.7 billion to construct the wall, and the federal government has been partially shut down for weeks over his demands. Democrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures.

The partial shutdown, which affects about a quarter of the federal government, reached its 21st day on Friday, with no end in sight.

So my questions is

1. If my premium processing gets rejected and I am forced to file for another extension (normal), can I stay in US For 240 days? Does it break any rule? I have been in US for past 5 yr and my application for GC is complete. Will staying after Feb 2019 cause any issues?

Case a. My premium extension with current client get accepted. All good. Nothing to worry.

Case b. My premium extension with current client get rejected. Option 1 We file for another extension with new client. I move back to my country of origin by Jan 20th and wait for the results of new extension. Get new stamping done. Come back if everything is good. If new extension is rejected then I stay back and will have to apply for new H1b in 2020.

case c.  My premium extension with current client get rejected. Option 1 We file for another extension with new client. However I stay back in US.

They essentially said that they were not convinced my new job requires a college degree. This was really surprising and shocking, because my job was not low-paid, and was not with a consulting/outsourcing company. There were many news reports that USCIS was targeting and trying to get rid of people with lower-paying jobs (anything below $100k, or Level 1). The immigration attorneys who prepared my new job's petition had heard the same and didn't expect USCIS to deny my job since it was quite highly-paid. But it seems like the hatred of immigrants has grown so large that they now want to force even well-qualified highly-paid people (who are on visas) out.

My visa sponsoring company's name is [**HyperScience**](https://hyperscience.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in CS from a well-ranked American university. HyperScience is a VC-backed startup that's growing rapidly; and it's a product company, and not a consulting agency ***in any sense***. There are [only two other people](https://www.uscis.gov/h-1b-data-hub?topic_id=Hyper+Labs&state=All&city=&zip=&fy=All&naics=All) on the H-1B visa at HyperScience, so it's not ""*H-1B dependent*"" either. On the Labor Condition Application ([LCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application)), my job was listed with the *SOC Code* [*15-1132*](https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1132.00) *""Software Developers, Applications""*, [for which the Level 4 wage is $138,861 per year](https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?code=15-1132&area=35614&year=19&source=1), **which my base salary of $140,000 exceeds**. ([Here's the official U.S. Department of Labor website link](https://lcr-pjr.doleta.gov/index.cfm?event=ehLCJRExternal.dspCert&doc_id=3&visa_class_id=1&id=6770024) to the LCA that HyperScience filed for me: you can see under section F., a. (which is collapsed by default) that my wage level is marked as ""**IV**"", and my base salary is listed as $140,000.) Beyond the base salary, HyperScience offered other forms of compensation like $60,000 of stock options, $8,400 of 401k match, $2,000 in a [HRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Reimbursement_Account), full zero-premium zero-deductible medical/dental/vision with Aetna + [onemedical](https://www.onemedical.com/), free lunch everyday (through [served by stadium](https://servedbystadium.com/)), free gym membership, etc. Regarding the stock options: I have very high confidence that they'll be successful and grow significantly. If they grow 50%, the stock options are worth $30,000; if they grow 200%, it's worth $120,000. The 401k match, free lunch, etc is conservatively worth at least $15k. So my total compensation is *conservatively* **at least $185,000**.  It's also one of those rare companies with *30 days* *of* *paid time-off* – that's 6 weeks of vacation, on top of federal holidays. They also offered 6 months of ***paid*** parental leave (for any gender). It's rare for any company to be this family-friendly, but it's one of HyperScience's core values — [***see this blog post by the CEO***](https://www.hyperscience.com/blogs/family-values-our-benefits). *All of that is to say*: **I'm not underpaid**.

Besides the core assertion that they were not convinced my job requires a college degree, two other reasons that USCIS gave for the H-1B denial were: first, my job duties was not related to a ""specific project"", and so they were unable to determine if my job has ""*specialty occupation*"" work; and second, a job posting for my position on the HyperScience website did not list a degree (or other educational) requirements. For those wondering what ""*specialty occupation*"" is — it just means a job that requires a bachelor's degree at a minimum. USCIS 's essential claimed was that my job (of *Software Engineer*) does not need a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The spiel about that my ""job duties were not related to a specific project"" is nonsensical, because HyperScience is not a consulting/EVM company. They were ***clearly being disingenuous*** *on purpose*, since they went through the trouble of googling HyperScience, and they likely knew very well that HyperScience is not a consulting company. But they decided to act disingenuous. And, **denying** because ""*it could not be determined*"" is just malignant. HyperScience's immigration lawyers ([**Meltzer Hellrung**](https://www.meltzerhellrung.com/)) said that **the second point was unprecedented**. It's pretty common these days for tech jobs to not mention a degree as an absolute requirement. It seems like the USCIS adjudicating officer was actually malevolently  and impishly hunting for *excuses to deny*. In a diligent prejudiced search for reasons to deny, the USCIS official went on Google, typed in ""HyperScience"", found the [HyperScience Careers](https://www.hyperscience.com/locations/new-york-usa.php) page, and then found  [this job posting](https://jobs.lever.co/hyperscience/aea3d646-5706-4a7a-806c-c78eac2920f2), which matches my title of ""*Software Engineer - Frontend / Fullstack*"" (as listed in the LCA). The job posting unfortunately does not list a bachelor's degree as a necessary qualification. Many tech companies don't. The USCIS official then diabolically ***used*** ***this*** *as a reason to deny*. HyperScience nor its immigration lawyers were expecting them to find a random job posting online, and weaponize it. It's honestly quite unbelievable. It seems like the goal of USCIS today is to just get rid of as many people as possible.

I'm not the one of those underpaid H-1B visa holders that immigrant-haters are always screaming about. I'm well-paid. My work would have improved the lives of Americans with disability in a significant way. (HyperScience is helping the Social Security Administration significantly reduce the processing time for [Disability Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance) applications by automating various aspects of it.)  It's hard to find a job where you can have a positive social impact *in such a direct and tangible way as this*. USCIS denying my H-1B petition actually hurts the [millions of Americans](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table6c7.html) who apply for disability insurance each year. (Helping disabled people get ""on welfare"" is probably the last thing that Republicans care about though.) I came across an article on the NYTimes a while back called [Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/immigration-visa-h1b-trump-.html) — here's a quote from it:

>Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied \[...\]  
>  
>My two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a “specialty occupation” — that is, work that only someone with a bachelor’s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn’t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.

If someone that qualified can get denied, then it's no surprise they want to force me out of the U.S. as well. There obviously is a fair number of people at USCIS who just maliciously *hate immigrants from the depths of their hearts*, and whose daily joy is frivolously denying petitions. They probably laugh with glee every time they ruin the life of well-qualified people who have contributed positively to the U.S. economy for years (or who will do so). They just hate immigrants. ***UPDATE:*** [***See full copies of the letters here***](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/cd9y14/rfe_and_denial_letters_meltzer_hellrung/)***.*** *Here are a few relevant excerpts:*

Did my undergrad and grad, worked diligently for 3 years on OPT, paid my share of taxes, volunteered in the community. Did everything right.

The first and third (current) companies applied for H-1B, didn’t get selected. Now, my current company offered me two options: 1. Relocate to EU to work at the office there. 2. Wants me help hire and train my replacement. The option 1 seems very unlikely given the logistics and arrangements that need to be made before my EAD expires in 6 weeks, and uprooting my life after living 10 years here takes a little time. 
Option 2 seems so messed up. But I’m willing to do it as long as they try their best to relocate me. 

The final option is to leave the the US and my current company and move back to my country of origin, which seems like moving to a foreign land. 

On a personal level, I would have to leave my girlfriend of 5 years. We live together and it feels like we should just break up now so I can plan next steps.

There is the excellent explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/frnlln/coronavirus_faq_stimulus_checks_visa_holders/.

Excerpt below:

**Q: I'm on a work visa and my hours were cut OR my pay was reduced OR placed on no-pay leave OR furloughed. Can I stay?**

For nearly all work visas, any reduction of your hours or pay is functionally **equivalent to a lay off**. The only exception is if your LCA or petition specified an hourly wage instead of an annual wage; in this a reduction of hours may be acceptable (though you should check with your company's lawyers).

You may have a 60 day grace period, and if you wish to stay, look at the next question.

**Q: I'm on a E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, and TN and got laid off - what can I do?**

You have a 60 day grace period before you have to depart.

You have a couple of options, and you MUST pick one before the end of the grace period:

* Depart the United States
* For most work visas (except L-1), you can find a new job and have your employer file an I-129. You cannot start work until it is approved (3-10 months), unless you're on the H-1B.
* Apply for adjustment of status (if eligible) through marriage or work.
* Apply for a change of status to B with form I-539. Once approved, you can change back to a work visa status again with the I-129.
* Apply for a change of status to F for a course of study.",1586294802.0

First, Thank you for this community running. It has helped me a lot. :)

I am currently on H1B and there are strong chances I will see a layoff beginning of May as per Company's current situation. I am aware that I'll have a grace period if I gets laid off. If the situation gets better in next 4-6 months, same employer is wiling to sponsor me back. I have few questions on Bank accounts I have here in USA.

If I don't find another employer after layoff to do h1b transfer and if I need to go back to India,

\- Do I need to close my USA bank accounts before I leave?

\- Do we need to update the Bank about status change?

\- I have paperless billing, however all Bank communications come to residential address. Do we need to update them that I no longer be staying in US? Can we provide an alternate address of Family/Friend? Or can we add a close relative and make it a joint account?

\- I do have credit cards, which are valid until 2022. Do I need to close credit accounts before leave?

\- I believe if I can operate the accounts outside US, there won't be an issue using Debit card?

\- If I must have to close US bank account before I leave for India, anyone please suggest the best way to transfer all cash from US account to India account?

He applied for a green card back in July 2011 (EB 2: India).

Both sides of the H1B debate are right,17,832wb6,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/832wb6/both_sides_of_the_h1b_debate_are_right/,3,"Let me just clarify that I don't support the pig in the WH and am not anti-immigration.

But as a software engineer who has worked in multiple industries, I have numerous experiences working with H1Bs, and can safely conclude that yes, America should retain the H1B and expand the quota and improve workers' rights - but at the same time, the H1B is severely abused and those abuses need to be stopped.

In tech companies which actually *create user-facing products and services*, such as Microsoft and Google, my observation is that the H1B developers employed there are not taking anything away from US citizens, and are making well over $100k - even if they were being paid less than US citizens (which they're not), $100k is well above the median wage in the US. Plus these H1B workers are pretty damn smart. These types of development jobs truly require the best and brightest, and when you look at enrolment in the STEM programs of top American universities, you see that international students make up a disproportionately large share. Denying them the H1B is not smart.

On the other hand, in companies that *don't use their developers for final products/services*, e.g. internal IT tools for telecoms and banks, especially outside SF/NYC/Seattle/Boston, the H1B picture is completely different. In this scenario, it's not surprising to see H1Bs being the majority of the staff. They aren't even employed full-time - most are actually contractors from companies like Tata Consultancy Services. They often don't speak English fluently (and have terrible grammar in their emails) and their development skills range from absolute garbage to barely acceptable. With the salary floor for H1B being a paltry $60k, it's also obvious that they're being used to reduce costs - especially since all they do is support work and they don't directly create anything of value for the company. Working with them can be quite frustrating, even if they're actually good people, due to communication barriers and sheer lack of technical skill. Plus, many of these people are seeking green cards - the wait times now being over 10 years for Indian and Chinese citizens - so they get treated like s**t and overworked, since they can't just turn around and quit without forfeiting their best shot at a green card. 

And since Indian contracting firms like Tata FLOOD the H1B application pool, their underpaid contractors win most of the visas, while talented people who MS and Google could use (and pay well) get left in the dust.

How would you solve this? It's simple - raise the salary floor to $100k, and BLACKLIST these contracting firms. H1Bs should only be for jobs that directly create a product or service of value. Even if the number of visas isn't increased, these two very simple steps would make our top-tier tech companies very happy, while also addressing concerns that the H1B program is taking away American jobs.

Premium Processing is a Scam,18,gtyxm3,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/gtyxm3/premium_processing_is_a_scam/,13,"There has been a lot of excitement and discussion about USCIS allowing premium processing for H-1B petitions in June.  Keeping in mind the law says they should take 30 days to process an H-1B, and initial (cap) H-1Bs should be decided by now, the concept of holding off decisions until the last minute is highly suspect.

That, and all premium processing does is guarantee an RFE.  The agency sends the RFE so they can reset the clock.  So, pay premium processing and expect your case to take an additional 90 days.

There is another, cheaper, way to get your petitions decided on time. It also has the benefit of depriving this quasi-criminal organization of your money.  Sue them for an unreasonable delay.",1590960002.0

The process does take a toll on all of us; however, I find it counterproductive to rant about the issues and read all the negative news. I thought that we can start a topic to discuss healthy strategies to deal with stress and keep being productive while we are going through this emotionally taxing process.

&#x200B;

One thing that I found helpful is to remind myself that a denial is not the end of the world. In the current climate, a rejection can happen to any of us; however, (assuming that all H1B applicants are indeed skilled workers) there are so many opportunities for us all around the world. Who knows: a rejection might even lead to a more successful/happier life in a job that we wouldn't consider otherwise. Let's try to maintain positive vibes while crossing our fingers!

Trump to H-1B visa holders: 'Path to citizenship' could be coming soon,16,aexw3x,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/aexw3x/trump_to_h1b_visa_holders_path_to_citizenship/,16," 

[President Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) on Friday indicated plans to change policies for visa holders, tweeting that a ""path to citizenship"" for H-1B holders was potentially possible under his administration.

In a tweet posted as the president returned from his trip the day before to the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump declared that the U.S. desires to see ""talented and highly skilled people"" immigrate to the U.S. and pursue careers.

""H1-B \[sic\] holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,"" Trump said.

""We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.,"" he continued.

 

The H-1B system, which allows U.S. companies to hire temporary foreign workers to fill needs not met by the U.S. workforce, is not intended as a permanent path to citizenship for immigrants coming to the United States.

Immigration reform has been a centerpiece of the Trump administration.

The president has battled Democrats in Congress for weeks over his proposed border wall. He has demanded $5.7 billion to construct the wall, and the federal government has been partially shut down for weeks over his demands. Democrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures.

The partial shutdown, which affects about a quarter of the federal government, reached its 21st day on Friday, with no end in sight.

Hope you're all staying healthy! Quick summary of my situation - OPT (already on STEM extension) expires May 31st. Last try for H1B, non-AD, PP (well, which is suspended I guess). I do have a job offer from a Canadian firm, and they're OK pushing my start date out. However, with borders being closed, even if I get my permit tomorrow, I can't go there.

&#x200B;

1. Is anyone else in the same boat as me? (at least with regards to the OPT issue) And, if so, what are you guys doing?
2. I know we have overstay - 180 days without a penalty. Does that start after my OPT end date, or after my H1B rejection comes in?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

As promised, checked in with international coordinator. Grace period of 60 days - starts the moment the OPT expires. Potential ""workaround"" to stay here longer while the pandemic blows over (assuming you have some other back up plan) is to apply for a change of status to tourist. You won't need to leave the country for that. Hope this helps someone!",1585134995.0

Earnest question about the covid situation,6,hrhvfb,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hrhvfb/earnest_question_about_the_covid_situation/,25,"America hasn't contained the virus.

We are number 1 in the world in active cases.

Half the states are experiencing record numbers of daily infections.

And we are going to open the economy, open schools, and bicker about wearing masks. 

I truly dont see how any of this helps the current situation. 

My question  is, what is the endgame here? What is the plan? Anytime Trump gives a speech on it he constantly cites how we have the most tests in the world, and how our mortality rate being down is evidence that we are containing it.

Quite frankly the facts just do not support these positions. The US may have the most tests, but not the most per capita, if the rate of reported infections was up due to increased testing , we would expect the ratio of positive to negative tests to be constant or to decline. But in fact the ratio is increasing in favor of more positive cases.

And as far as the death rate claim, quite frankly the decreased death rate is likely a result that current carrying population is about 20-30 years younger than the first outbreak. 


Dont get me wrong I dont want to see another lockdown or quarrantine,  but the fact is they do work. 

Canada and Europe have both banned travel from the usa and it's not becuase they are jerks, its becuase we have failed to contain this with no likely end in sight.",1594820011.0

This may sound bogus, but I believe the Left is helping Biden, so that they can run him against Trump.... in hopes of him losing.

Why? Well here is what I think.

First of all, Biden would no way run anything if he was in office. I think that the Democrats in the Govt. at the moment would run the US behind the curtains, and use him as a Puppet. Sure, Trump wouldnt let them run things, but they would still have power.

Second, if Biden wins, where would the Fake/Biased and money making news go? Think about it. If Trump wins, they can make up stories about Russia again, or China, whatever, helping Trump and making millions of money from that stupid news. They also would have someone and an entire party to blame all of our country’s problems on for another 4 years, all while again making and selling fake news.

Do you even want to see sports come back this year?,0,hqrlk2,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hqrlk2/do_you_even_want_to_see_sports_come_back_this_year/,7,"I just turned on an MLS game and one team is wearing Black Lives Matter shirts.

At this point I DO NOT want sports back this year. With every league saying they will be taking the knee during the National Anthem, players as well as leagues promoting social justice couses, owners and players fighting about how much they should be paid based on shorten season/smaller revenue due to no fans at games . I watch sports as a couple of hours escape from every day life and I am afraid this year sports will not be providing that escape for me. So as for me I would just as well have sports come back in the 2021/22 season.

How Trump Can Save His Re-Election:,4,hqmx5m,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hqmx5m/how_trump_can_save_his_reelection/,4,"Here Are Two Ways Trump Can Ensure He Wins:

Trump’s Mask Mandate:

“... The issue of public health, and public safety is NOT one that should be decided by politicians, and voting, but by the need to protect our people, and to limit the spread of evil. So with this information collected by the CDC, as well as seeing the patterns that countries such as Italy have taken, and suffered under, I am now mandating that’s when you are in public, that you MUST wear some sort of face covering, such as a mask. And this order CAN NOT be ignored by state governments, no matter how small their outbreaks are. As well, enforced social distancing, and many other measures must be taken in order to protect our country from avoidable disaster...”

Trump’s Police Reform Speech:

“...The issue of Police Brutality has long been under the surface, it has been largely ignored by many people who wish to not look at the unfortunate reality that many black Americans will be killed by police who should not have the power that they have. Due to these circumstances surrounding the recent death of George Floyd, I will be issuing a bill that will allocate all of the unnecessary funds that go to police, that can enable them to commit awful acts of evil. These funds will go to paying teachers more, and to improve the education system as a whole. They will also go to improving the immigration system to pave a safe, and secure way for immigrants to make it into this country. These funds will go to many more underfunded institutions, and these funds will help them as a whole. The Police should not be thought of as a occupying force, but rather as one that serves, and protects its community, and does not discriminate based on race. These reforms will create a better policing system...”",1594700382.0

I get that it was a meme post but saying he's the best president ever is just really dumb to say. He's not you can look at any research data , polls(both left and right ones) and for the most part, the top 3 are usually Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

I just don't think its smart to say that, makes us seem really dumb. Even when Obama was president and every liberal that said he was the best I thought they were dumb. We constantly think the next president is the best and I think it just makes us sound really dumb. 

No hate guys I just don't think he's ""THE BEST"" he's a good president that I agree with but not the best:)

p.s If you really do think he's the best though then that's ok, I just think that when you look at what some of our greatest presidents have done you would realize why I think its dumb to say that:)",1594642099.0

Jessica Doty Whitaker Shot & Killed BY BLM After ‘All Lives Matter’ Argument,51,hq4h2e,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hq4h2e/jessica_doty_whitaker_shot_killed_by_blm_after/,10,"A young mother was shot and killed on July 5 following an argument over the Black Lives Matter movement, according to her family. 24-year-old Jessica Doty Whitaker was with her fiance, Jose Ramirez, and two other people by the downtown canal in Indianapolis in the early hours of Sunday, July 5, when their group entered into a dispute with another group over the use of a racial slur, Ramirez told Fox59.

The dispute was eventually settled, Ramirez shared, but minutes later it turned fatal when shots were fired from the other group, hitting Whitaker. Ramirez told WTHR, “I was actually holding her when it happened. She just fell. I turned around, and I opened fire too. But that’s just a reaction. I didn’t see nobody.” He said he doesn’t believe he hit anyone.

Whitaker leaves behind her 3-year-old son. She was 24 years old, a home health nurse who was set to return to school in August and marry Ramirez in a year, WTHR reported. The fatal shooting is still under investigation.
Whitaker’s Fiance Said the Fatal Dispute Was Over the Black Lives Matter Movement

Ramirez told Fox59 that they were by the canal when someone in his group used the N-word during a conversation, which led to a confrontation with another group of strangers, four men and a woman. Ramirez said that someone in the other group yelled “Black Lives Matter,” to which someone in his group answered, “All Lives Matter.” Ramirez did not confirm if Whitaker or someone else said it. Ramirez said that the dispute ended when they realized that both groups were armed, bumped fists and walked away from each other.

He said that short minutes after, someone from the other group opened fire on them from a bridge and then fled the scene. “It was squashed and they went up the hill and left we thought, but they were sitting on St. Clair waiting for us to come under the bridge and that’s when [Whitaker] got shot.”

The shooting occurred on the 700 block of Canal Court just after 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, July 5. When the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) arrived on the scene, they found Whitaker, who had injuries consistent with a gunshot wound. She was brought to the hospital in critical condition and later died of her wounds.

Ramirez told WTHR, “I’ll never probably ever get that image out of my head of what happened.” Whitaker’s mother, Arlena Doty, added, “I’m never going to get to hold her again. I just want the people who are responsible to be held accountable.” They said they’ll do everything they can to help Whitaker’s son remember his mother as he grows up.
The Indianapolis Police Are Investigating the Shooting, Which Is the Second Homicide by the Canal in the Past Week

IMPD community assistance requested on canal shootingHomicide detectives are asking for assistance from the community on a canal shooting.2020-07-09T02:17:46Z

The IMPD is still looking into the shooting and no suspects have been publicly identified at this time. According to Fox59, the department has asked the public for assistance. The outlet shared a video obtained by homicide detectives that shows there were a few people in the area at the time of the shooting. They are asking for anyone who was around the canal at that time to call the IMPD Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317-262-8477 or (TIPS).

It’s the second homicide at the canal in the same week, after 14-year-old Curtis White Junior died during an attempted armed robbery, police said. IMPD captain Jerry Leary told Fox59, “Our message is that the canal is still safe to go. Just recently the DMD is hiring two overtime officers to work the canal during those times nightly. A combination of all those efforts we hope is going to make a difference and it can’t help to.”",1594625459.0

He seriously couldn't have planned it better himself. These people don't try to fix anything or engage in civil discourse, they're all brainwashed and maybe some of them truly think they're fighting evil and racism meanwhile they're only creating more of it. 


Not only will they not succeed in getting DJT out of the Whitehouse but they're decimating the entire democrat party, if Ye gets on the ballot he will get votes, that helps Republicans, thank you. If you keep making wealthy or even moderate democrats leave the democrats that helps DJT, if you keep harassing hardworking Americans who pay taxes we will move away from your cities just like we always have and you will be left with a slum.

  Companies will leave America and take their money and educated people with them, this will be a 3rd world country if the democrats get back in office. And they will hand you a monthly stipend and feed you and everyone around you will fees off you too, because without police you will be at the mercy of stupid, angry really bad people. Drug runners, gun runners, gangs of people that will kill each other over whats left. 

If any of these SJWs actually looked up all of the failed democrat policies and cities and realized they've been lied to maybe they'd use that energy and time to do something positive with their own lives instead of blaming everyone else for their own problems. I hope republicans keep posting facts and information so more people can be unbrainwashed by the Leftists agenda.

I use to hate Trump because that is what the media was telling me. I was a hard core Bernie guy and watching how big of a following Bernie had it seemed like it was going well, then one day he drops out and endorses Hillary without an explanation as to why he dropped out. I was a bit confused as to why and i did my own research and thats when i started to realize that we're being played. Looking into what Hillary had to offer and with damaging dirt exposing her, The whole Democratic Party was showing its true colors and i could see that. Doing more research on Trump and looking at the past and seeing the type of Person he was and still is i took that Redpill and i haven't looked back. I'm even more of a Trump supporter than i was back in 2016. I like to do my research first before i settle on something, Knowledge is power.",1594434582.0

Who exactly is racist?,8,honkpn,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/honkpn/who_exactly_is_racist/,3,"As with everything else I like to do my own research and come up with my own informed answers. This one is no different. Here are a few excerpts and links for everyone to form their own opinions:

https://www.diffen.com/difference/Democrat_vs_Republican#Civil_Rights

""Civil Rights

Abraham Lincoln belonged to the Republican Party, so the roots of the party lie in individual freedom and the abolition of slavery. Indeed, 82% of the Republicans in the U.S. Senate voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 while only 69% of Democrats did. The Southern wing of the Democratic party was vehemently opposed to civil rights legislation. 

However, after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, there was a sort of role reversal. (Todd Purdum)""

""Republicans believe that Purdum's point of view is misleading because Goldwater supported previous attempts at passing a Civil Rights act, and desegregation, but did not like the 1964 Act because he felt it infringed on states' rights.""


All I had to do was search for ""Goldwater 1964 act infringed states"" and found this.

https://freedomsjournalinstitute.org/uncategorized/urban-legend-goldwater-against-civil-rights/

""More specifically, Goldwater had problems with title II and Title VII of the 1964 bill. He felt that constitutionally the federal government had no legal right to interfere in who people hired, fired; or to whom they sold their products, goods, and services. He felt that “power” laid in the various states, and with the people. He was a strong advocate of the tenth amendment. Goldwater’s constitutional stance did not mean he agreed with the segregation and racial discrimination practiced in the South. To the contrary, he fought against these kinds of racial divides in his own state of Arizona.""

It's all about how you look at things. Maybe if they actually debated the bill and reformed it he wouldn't have had an issue with it but because he didn't AGREE with it they stated that he was AGAINST the bill. There's a big difference between the two.",1594410749.0

Now, more than ever, American teens are being fooled by the radical left so that they can play a role as useful idiots in the hands of Democratic politicians. They are following a long-desired agenda that has strong ties to communist Antonio Gramsci's philosophy (cultural revolution), which is **evidently** being put into practice! 

Their plan is clear: pretend to be friends with brainwashed movements in order to convince them to vote for racist, mentally unfit Joe Biden. In case they succeed, Biden resigns for his **radical-left VP** to take office and turn America into a weak, shitty place to live in, with violence spreading everywhere and without any **INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY**!

I may alter the guidelines a bit if the voting is skewed heavily in favor of one candidate (which could definitely happen, if this post does better in r/Trump than in r/JoeBiden or vise versa), but for the most part, I won't change anything.

However....",28,hn9h2b,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hn9h2b/i_have_been_on_the_trump_train_since_the_day_he/,23,"I am never voting Democrat again. I am independent (unaffiliated) for voting. I voted straight party for the mid-terms, but have always voted for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. 

Trump is kicking butt and I want the biggest landslide in our country's history this year. 

Saying all of that, I am begging Trump to go easy on a few things. There are moderate liberals, including black people who will vote for Trump. There are liberals who will vote for Trump. This election may come down to those groups helping us get him elected. We are fighting terror groups, foreign countries, crooked politicians, the MSM and everyone else that is trying to get rid of Trump. 

I honestly believe the left wants to destroy our country. They don't like us. 

There are just some small things that Trump needs to overlook. 

1. Bubba Wallace -NASCAR - trust me, I get both sides. We are in a very hyper-sensitive crisis right now. I wish Trump would have handled it differently.  The FBI came in said it was not a hate act aimed at Bubba and I think Bubba handled it as well as he could, but he was told a noose was found in his garage. He was in a tough situation, NASCAR was in a tough situation and there wasn't much that was easy with all of that. 

2. Twitter fights and insults. I kept his jabs at Rosie. I love that stuff. The problem is that he doesn't have to get in every fight with everyone. Some of the stuff just needs to go to the wayside. Pick your battles and make them matter. 

3. Those of us on the Trump train need to be above board. Dont be the Trump person yelling and screaming or threatening someone. We need to continue to treat others as we want to be treated. 

4. Masks - I will probably get some hate on this one. I personally feel like this has been blown way out of proportion, but if I have to wear a mask, I wear one. I have gotten some stares, but I don't care. Wear the mask, it will help keep our economy open. It is a mask that you wear for a very short period. 

I want Trump in 2020 and we all know the left will continue their hate, violence and lies. It is up to us to step up and do what is right. Educate people, debate them, but don't fight them in the name of Trump. 

We are better than this. The left drives me crazy, but it motivates me to be better. I hate the way our society is becoming so ugly and we all have to be the grown ups to help this country heal.",1594207273.0

Just a personal observation,4,hn1g8b,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hn1g8b/just_a_personal_observation/,15,"So I have something to say and this post in no way is to hate on something or someone, just an observation that I have made that made me angry over the past years as a republican conservative. I grew up in a republican family on the east coast and I absolutely love my country and respect everyone. But since starting college I have observed so many international students being ungrateful and making hate comments about United States. This hurt me. Because I never understood why someone traveled all the way from his/her country to go to a college and absolutely hate their culture / complain about their environment. The people who I talked to always complained about how classes / professors / American culture / American values / the resources available is horrible in United States despite them using the same resources I am using and I never complaining. And I am not talking about 1-2 people, more like 40-60 people who I have heard this from... I never said anything as I understood that my culture and background is different and I never wanted to come off as a person who is blind to others values..... but I became infuriated from the inside when I saw that nearly all international students around me are ungrateful of what they have which is similar to what I have at college and always said “ugh I wish I wasn’t here” so I always was angry and never said “if you hate it here then why are you here?” 

Cut to today which I heard about ICE’s new law which I think is not a good idea since international students contribute so much to our country but at the same time I kinda felt indifferent about them and their future which I think is horrible of me since I should show sympathy... 

So my whole conclusion for everything I said is international students should be allowed to stay despite online classes, but i also realized that not everyone who receive visas respect the chance that they are given and there should be a more strict way of assessing who deserves a visa And who doesn’t. 

Also sorry for this long post I am just a college student with my side of the story.",1594179459.0

Am I the only one who thinks China is engineering bioweapons?,21,hmzej0,trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/hmzej0/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_china_is_engineering/,18,"I originally tried posting this in the Conservative subreddit but apparently it was rejected along with like four other posts I tried making so fuck those guys. 

The new outbreak of the swine flu in China leads me to believe that Chinese scientists are intentionally creating new viruses to use against the people. Both this swine flu and Virus were in a lab before becoming pandemic potential, and the CCP claimed they are only transmitted from animals to humans, like they learned literally nothing from last time. 

Releasing these viruses are a way to keep the whole world, especially Hong Kong, under quarantine, which necessarily represses the people and media. This is way to control their protestors in Hong Kong, and keep the rest of the world out of the loop, giving them more freedom to continue their illegal activities in the South China Sea.

Another benefit is the fact that so much of our lives have been moved to the internet due to the pandemic and since China controls such a large portion of the internet, it provides outstanding economic and control opportunities for them (think Zoom and Tik Tok). If they can't conquer other countries through political means, they can establish, or rather at this point, further develop their mercantilist economy through internet control. Not to mention if other countries are shut down but China remains open, because they knew the virus was coming and took measures ahead of time, they may continue to dominate the outsourcing and production industry, which has been under fire for a while. Lockdown could indeed be a way to protect this aspect of their economy since politicians and businesses have been calling for and moving to Vietnam, India, and other locations, respectively.   

It just doesn't seem plausible to be coincidental...",1594173086.0

So far, I have this:

-Violent crime has fallen every year he’s been in office after rising the 2 years before he was elected

-Under Trump’s leadership, in 2018 the U.S. surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest producer of crude oil

-The 25% lowest-paid Americans enjoyed a 4.5% income boost in November 2019, that outpaces a 2.9% gain in earnings for the country's highest-paid workers

-Lowest unemployment rate among all demographic groups, but especially Black and Hispanic people before the Chinese Virus

-In 2018, President Trump signed the groundbreaking First Step Act, a criminal justice bill which enacted reforms that make our justice system fairer and help former inmates successfully return to society (over 90% of those benefiting from the retroactive sentencing reductions in the First Step Act are Black Americans)

-Because of a bill signed and championed by Trump, In 2020, most federal employees will see their pay increase by an average of 3.1% — the largest raise in more than 10 years

-New single-family home sales are up 31.6% in October 2019 compared to just one year ago

-Signed the first Perkins CTE reauthorization since 2006, authorizing more than $1 billion for states each year to fund vocational and career education programs

-Withdrew the U.S. from the job killing TPP deal

-Under Trump, the FDA approved more affordable generic drugs than ever before in history

-Secured $6 billion in new funding to fight the opioid epidemic

-The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by Trump doubled the maximum amount of the child tax credit available to parents and lifted the income limits so more people could claim it. It also created a new tax credit for other dependents.

**Edit: added these**


-Enacted police reform following George Floyd’s death

-Pardon of Jack Johnson

-Deportation of a former Nazi

-Release of Alice Johnson following a clemency, a 63 year old grandmother jailed in 1996 over a nonviolent drug charge

-Designation of MLK’s birthplace as a national history park

-Visited Jerusalem while in office",1594128607.0

What are my options?

Just wanted to get some second opinions on what my options are considering my situation right now

I'm in the US, working on my STEM OPT which is valid till May 2021. I got picked in last year's H-1B lottery and was due to travel to India (home) a few months ago to get stamping done but due to COVID everything got messed up. My company lawyers have asked me not to worry and have advised me that we will re-evaluate the plan of action in a month, depending on the situation. However, considering that they \*are\* my company's lawyers in the end, I wanted to get an idea of what my options are. The way I see it (and mostly what the lawyers agree with too), I have the following options:

1. If things reopen, I can go to India and get stamping done well before May 2021 (best case)
2. If things are okay but India itself is a risky destination to visit a neighboring country, probably Canada and get the stamping done (not a bad scenario)
3. If travel is not possible for the near future, I apply for a Change Of Status. Travel wouldn't be an issue here but the risk here is of it being a new petition and possibly attracting an RFE. In normal circumstances this would not be an issue since my role and company are pretty legit, with a history of successful and in fact nearly perfect attempts as far as H-1B goes. But given the current climate and weekly threats from You Know Who on immigration, this seems slightly worrying.

I guess what I'm asking is, have I missed out any other option or have I evaluated my current options wrongly?   


Also, my company's policies actually allow me to request Green Card petitioning now. Will this help in any way in terms of the immediate status? I know it makes sense to file anyway because there's nothing to lose and I intend to initiate this right away but is there any way where applying for it can be leveraged to lessen this risk of anything untoward happening by May 2021 (my STEM OPT expiration date)",1591953827.0

Please give some advice. I work for a company as a mechanical engineer for 2 years and one internship. I have one year left on my STEM OPT and one chance at H1B. The company wanted to sponsor me when they hired me, but later said no due to cost. Since I could not find another job, I stayed at the same company. I pretty much had given up on the process with them. I was just saving money to potentially emigrate to Canada next year. Recently, some key personnel left the company and I was put in a more must-have position. My boss started talking about sponsorship again since they are having a hard time finding someone to do our niche work. Anyway, I do not want to raise my expectations and be frustrated again, but I will at least do the best I can at my new position and hope for the best. 

Last time, the lawyer that we contacted proposed 4500 for the H1B (filling fees included) and 4600 (filing fees included) for the EB3, and the company also had to bring my salary up by 9 thousand to meet prevailing wage (they pay me kind of below market right, not super low, but low). 

I already spent 300 hundred dollars consulting lawyers on my own and I just wanted to know from you guys if these fees look reasonable or If I should keep looking for another lawyer. 

I told my boss that I would need EB3 and h1b filed at the same time since I only had a small chance to get h1b now. They could have me working from home country for a while while green card finishes processing. If I don’t get h1b. I’m also from a country that priority date is current. 

One of the questions raised was if company had to pay me the prevailing wage right away, or if they had some lead time. From my understanding, they only has to start paying the prevailing wage in October after h1b is approved? And for the EB3, maybe halfway the process? Or as soon as they start the application?

I know it has been an incredibly stressful time due to the uncertainties that COVID-19 has brought with it. I am posting this seeking advice in a delicate situation I have found myself in.

I am currently a final-year undergraduate on an F1 visa and have applied for my OPT EAD with mid-July start date. My employer filed for the H1B lottery and I was fortunate enough to get through. They were going to file my petition this cycle (Apr 1 - June 30.)

However, I've found myself in a difficult position academically; I'm on track to not get a passing grade in one of my classes that is a graduation requirement for one of my majors (I am a dual-major student.)

My two options are: 

1) Drop the second major to graduate in time, get issued a new I-20 (but that will affect the OPT EAD app I have sent out since it will have my old I-20.) This would mean I would have to re-apply to OPT, wait another 3 months without starting my job which wouldn't be ideal. 

2) Take a summer class (from mid June to early August) and still graduate with 2 majors. My OPT EAD, if approved, would arrive somewhere in mid June or July. I will accrue around 20 ""unemployment days"" but I can request to start at work 1 month later than my originally scheduled start date. 

I have already contacted my employer about this and waiting to hear back about what they say.

What will be the effect of this on my H1B application? I know my employer submitted some of my documents for the H1B lottery (they asked for letters from my academic advisors saying I will graduate in Spring 2020) and my I-20 with 2 majors as well. Can they add ""updated"" documents to the H1B petition that will be filed in the summer? 

What is the best course of action for me? 

I would really appreciate any and all advise, since I'm feeling pretty anxious about all the ""what ifs"" and would like to plan for the best and worst cases.",1588532851.0

I got picked in the H1-B lottery, and my employer is currently preparing my petition. I'm wondering if I should file as **Change of Status vs Consular Processing**. I understand that Consular Processing allows for more control over when the H1-B status kicks in, but am curious to know if there are other considerations to keep in mind given the COVID-19 pandemic. Does Consular Processing come with an increased risk of denial at the embassy/consulate or is it the obvious choice given the increased travel flexibility? Any other pros/cons that I'm missing?

EDIT: The one pro I see with Consular Processing is that if I travel outside the U.S. (before or after October), and if embassies are facing delays, I can choose not to get my H1-B stamped on that trip, and travel back on F-1. At-least that's my understanding.

To-clarify, the STEM extension will allow me to continue working on my OPT for 2 years, giving me that period to activate my H1-B if I choose Consular Processing.

**The Rule Changes on January 17, 2017**

Among the avalanche of immigration rules changes that Obama made two days before he left office, were clarifications and C.F.R. amendments relating to the 6-year limit. Here's the federal register link to the relevant section: [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#p-685](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#p-685)

Here's one excerpt:

>In response to public comment, DHS is also providing several clarifications in the final rule. First, DHS has amended the regulatory text at [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(C) to more clearly provide that remaining H-1B time may be recaptured at any time before the foreign worker uses the full period of H-1B admission described in section 214(g)(4) of the INA. Second, DHS has made several edits to simplify and streamline the regulatory text at [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D), which describes eligibility for the “lengthy adjudication delay” exemption afforded by section 106(a) and (b) of AC21 to the general 6-year maximum period of H-1B admission. In particular, the final rule makes clear that to be eligible for this exemption, the individual must have had an application for labor certification or a Form I-140 petition filed on his or her behalf at least 365 days before the date the exemption would take effect. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D)(*1*), (*5*), and (*7*). The final rule further clarifies that an individual becomes ineligible for the lengthy adjudication delay exemption if he or she fails to apply for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa within 1 year of the date an immigrant visa is authorized for issuance. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D)(*10*). The final rule also clarifies that exemptions pursuant to section 106(a) of AC21 may only be made in 1-year increments. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(D)(*2*).

And here is a more pertinent excerpt:

>I. RECAPTURE OF H-1B TIME  
>  
>*Comment.* A few commenters urged DHS to clarify that there is no “statute of limitations” on recapture. Some of these commenters noted that nothing in INA 214(g)(7) restricts USCIS from granting unused H-1B time when a recapture request is made more than 6 years after the initial grant of the H-1B petition. One commenter asked DHS to clarify that time spent inside the United States in another nonimmigrant status is “recapturable.” This commenter stated that the proposed regulatory text allows recapture only for time in which the foreign national was physically outside the United States.  
>  
>*Response.* In the final rule, DHS clarifies that, consistent with its existing policy, there is no time limitation on recapturing the remainder of the initial 6-year period of H-1B admission under INA 214(g)(4).\[[83](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#footnote-83-p82449)\] DHS notes, however, that the remainder of any time granted pursuant to an AC21 extension cannot be recaptured. The purpose of this clarification is to promote consistency and efficiency in recapture determinations in accordance with the policy objectives described in USCIS's December 5, 2006 policy memorandum from Michael Aytes outlining the recapture policy.\[[84](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#footnote-84-p82449)\]  
>  
>The relevant USCIS policy memoranda,\[[85](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled#footnote-85-p82449)\] although not codified, specify that the “remainder” period of the initial 6-year admission period is that full admission period minus any time that the H-1B nonimmigrant worker previously spent in the United States in valid H-1B or L-1 status. This policy thus allows time spent inside the United States in any other nonimmigrant status (*i.e.,* any nonimmigrant status other than H-1B or L-1) to be “recapturable.” This final rule does not impose any additional limits on this policy. *See* final [8 CFR 214.2](https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2016/11/18/8-CFR-214.2)(h)(13)(iii)(C).

I’ve been in the US since December 2015 and my final 797 ends in Jan 2021. My visa stamp expired in August 2018.

My current employer was in the process of applying my I-140 and for that HR kept bugging me constantly to get my visa stamping done. So despite my better judgement I travelled to India in March and got my stamping done.

Then I got stuck here because of flights not flying.

Now the company is cutting costs and has asked me to accept a position in the India office and they *might* bring me back. I said I have rent and car payments in the US so I can’t do that. They said “tough luck”.

So currently I’m negotiating with them that they keep me on leave without pay until I can return so that I can find another job.

Do you guys think I have a case for wrongful termination here? My reasoning being that it was them who enticed me with I-140 application and a may 2020 deadline to get the stamping done and now they’re screwing me when I’m stuck here.

I have evidence that even in late January they were bugging me to go. I even verbally told HR that the virus might get me stuck there but they didn’t take it seriously. 
State is NC if that matters.

&nbsp;

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond to my queries. I talked with my company and said that my time is more valuable than a Rupee salary and that I'll not work for them at all if they put me on India salary. They changed tune and now I'll be paid the US salary without any problems and I can go back when flights start. I think they were just fishing to see if I was desperate for keeping a job and trying to take advantage of that.",1586590431.0

H1b laid off - Returning back to India with a plan to come back,23,fyhx5n,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/fyhx5n/h1b_laid_off_returning_back_to_india_with_a_plan/,16,"Hello,

First, Thank you for this community running. It has helped me a lot. :)

I am currently on H1B and there are strong chances I will see a layoff beginning of May as per Company's current situation. I am aware that I'll have a grace period if I gets laid off. If the situation gets better in next 4-6 months, same employer is wiling to sponsor me back. I have few questions on Bank accounts I have here in USA.

If I don't find another employer after layoff to do h1b transfer and if I need to go back to India,

\- Do I need to close my USA bank accounts before I leave?

\- Do we need to update the Bank about status change?

\- I have paperless billing, however all Bank communications come to residential address. Do we need to update them that I no longer be staying in US? Can we provide an alternate address of Family/Friend? Or can we add a close relative and make it a joint account?

\- I do have credit cards, which are valid until 2022. Do I need to close credit accounts before leave?

\- I believe if I can operate the accounts outside US, there won't be an issue using Debit card?

\- If I must have to close US bank account before I leave for India, anyone please suggest the best way to transfer all cash from US account to India account?

Changes in H-1B Terms and Conditions of Employment,17,fxaape,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/fxaape/changes_in_h1b_terms_and_conditions_of_employment/,2,"  

Re: Changes in H-1B Terms and Conditions of Employment

Many employers have implemented sudden and previously unanticipated changes in the terms and conditions of H-1B (and E-3) employees. Some of those changes may be viewed to be “material” major changes requiring additional steps, while other changes may be less significant and not require additional steps. Decisions regarding these matters must be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting with the employer’s immigration attorney. 

H-1B and E-3 visa matters are supported by the Labor Condition Application (“LCA”) on Form ETA-9035, which must be certified (approved) by the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA confirms important aspects of the terms and conditions of employment including the job title, SOC/OES job classification code, worksite location(s), the prevailing wage (often a wage obtained through a DOL salary table for same/ similar positions) , and the “actual” wage paid to the sponsored employee. 

If an employer changes any aspect of what is promised in the LCA document, the safest and most conservative option would be to terminate the employee, or to obtain a new LCA and file a new petition with USCIS to accommodate the change whether material or not. There are some circumstances under which a new LCA and new petition are clearly required. There are also some circumstances under which a new LCA is not required, but a posting requirement may apply, and some circumstances under which the law may not be clear on what if any additional steps may or may not be required. In managing compliance efforts, some employers may be in the difficult position of how best to allocate scarce time and financial resources, and may not want or be able to take steps that are not clearly required. Other employers may choose to take additional steps out of an abundance of caution, even if not clearly required. 

The following Q&A may help to highlight some common scenarios, and possible alternatives. For each, a citation to a specific legal authority is included. Just as doctors must apply professional judgment in prescribing the correct medicine, in the correct dose, for the correct patient, immigration attorneys may recommend different courses of action for different employers and employees because even cases that may appear on the surface to be very similar, may not be exactly the same, and changing just one fact may change what is or is not a legally valid option. For any recommendation made, the attorney should be able to point to a specific source of law that supports the position. 

Q: My company closed its California office and is moving all of its H-1B employees to South Dakota. Is an “amended petition” required?

A: The employer is required to obtain a new LCA and file an amended I-129 petition with USCIS before moving the employee to the new work site. \[*Matter of Simeio Solutions, Inc.*, 26 I&N Dec. 542 (AAO 2015).\] 

Q: When is a new LCA required, and does that require the filing of a new petition with USCIS?

A: Material changes require a new LCA. These include moving the employee to a new work site outside the normal commuting distance of the original worksite, as well as material changes to the job duties outlined in the original petition. \[For example -- promoting an engineer to a completely different job category.\] Obtaining a new LCA also normally obligates the employer to take the additional step of filing of an updated I-129 petition with USCIS. \[See above. Also see: 20 CFR 655.715 for definition of “area of intended employment,” as well as “place of employment.”\]

Q: When is a new posting required, even if a new LCA is not required?

A: Moving the worksite to a new location within the normal commuting distance of the original worksite often requires a new posting, but not a new LCA. A common example is when a company moves to a new building in the same general metropolitan area. \[20 CFR 655.734\]

Q: Is working from home a new worksite, and does working from home trigger a new posting requirement?

A: Working from home (especially when home is within the normal commuting distance of the actual Company worksite) should not be viewed to be a different “worksite.” Instead, the employees are virtually accessing the actual worksite rather than doing so physically in person. The home should be deemed a “non-worksite” as the employee’s “regular work location” is the employer’s physical premises. In addition, there are administrative liaison notes confirming that the DOL does not expect telecommuting employees to post notices at home, unless home is not within the normal commuting distance of the physical worksite. It is also helpful to keep in mind that no U.S. worker applicant pool is being impacted or prejudiced by the employee working from home – especially if home is within normal commuting distance of the physical worksite. Note that WFH can be distinguished from the movement of a employer’s entire physical worksite, keeping in mind that moving the physical office could move the employer’s place of business into a different part of town with a new or expanded pool of U.S. workers who may benefit from the posting notice outlining the terms and conditions of a job sponsored by the employer. \[See: 20 CFR 655.715 for definition of “area of intended employment,” as well as “place of employment,” and “non-work site.”\]

Q: Is a new LCA or petition filing required if an employer lowers an employee’s salary?

A: It depends! It would not be permissible to lower the salary beyond the prevailing wage. The employer’s actual wage is subject to increase or decrease over time. Arguably, a reduction that did not go below the prevailing wage may be okay. \[See: 20 CFR 655.715 for definition of “required wage,” which is the higher of the “actual wage” that the employer pays for that role or the “prevailing wage” as determined by the applicable salary survey data. See also: 20 CFR 655.731(a)-(c).\] 

Q: Is it a violation for an employer to reduce a sponsored H-1B or E-3 employee’s hours?

A: This may depend on how the original LCA and petition were drafted. Does the change in hours move the employee from full time to part time? Was the original LCA drafted to note a wage based on hours worked, or a specific salary amount that will be paid monthly or yearly? How are the proposed new terms same or different from what is outlined in the certified LCA document? \[See: 20 CFR 655.731(a)-(c).\]

Q: What is the “short term placement” rule?

A: No new posting or LCA is required for a short term placement at a new worksite that was not anticpated at the time the original LCA was filed, as long as that placement does not exceed 30 days. This rule is often applied to a new physical worksite in a new metropolitan location, as may happen with a new short term project or assignment. \[20 CFR 655.735.\]",1586394309.0

There is the excellent explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/frnlln/coronavirus_faq_stimulus_checks_visa_holders/.

Excerpt below:

**Q: I'm on a work visa and my hours were cut OR my pay was reduced OR placed on no-pay leave OR furloughed. Can I stay?**

For nearly all work visas, any reduction of your hours or pay is functionally **equivalent to a lay off**. The only exception is if your LCA or petition specified an hourly wage instead of an annual wage; in this a reduction of hours may be acceptable (though you should check with your company's lawyers).

You may have a 60 day grace period, and if you wish to stay, look at the next question.

**Q: I'm on a E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, O-1, and TN and got laid off - what can I do?**

You have a 60 day grace period before you have to depart.

You have a couple of options, and you MUST pick one before the end of the grace period:

* Depart the United States
* For most work visas (except L-1), you can find a new job and have your employer file an I-129. You cannot start work until it is approved (3-10 months), unless you're on the H-1B.
* Apply for adjustment of status (if eligible) through marriage or work.
* Apply for a change of status to B with form I-539. Once approved, you can change back to a work visa status again with the I-129.
* Apply for a change of status to F for a course of study.",1586294802.0

H-1B Cap Lottery Update,21,ftq6kg,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/ftq6kg/h1b_cap_lottery_update/,0,"  

**H-1B Cap Lottery Update**

USCIS has completed the first round of its lottery process for assigning H-1B visa numbers this year. The H-1B petitions for person with “selected” numbers are now being prepared by employers and their attorneys, and will soon be finalized and filed with USCIS. That must happen before June 30, 2020. 

The requests filed on behalf of most others should still pending as “submitted,” but not yet “selected.” 

This is the first year that USCIS is using the electronic lottery process. Given the dramatic shifts happening in the U.S. economy for some employers at this time, it is possible that a number of “selected” visa numbers will not be used before the June 30 deadline. USCIS should then make those numbers available for the remaining pool of applicants who are still “registered” but have not yet been selected. In summary, the registrations that companies have submitted but which have not been assigned a number as of this date, may receive one later. For now persons hoping to obtain a number in a later round can only wait.

From October 1, USCIS will update the lottery web page to note “not selected” for any entries that are not assigned a number by that date. They have not done that yet because the lottery process is still continuing. The chance of receiving a number in going forward may be smaller, but this process will not be final until the new Federal Fiscal Year starts on October 1, 2020 (FY 2021).

As an additional note, please keep in mind that a “denied” notation indicates that the same employer attempted to submit more than one registration for the same foreign worker, which is not permitted. Thus, any registrations that did not yet receive a number and which have not been “denied,” should remain active in the continuing lottery process.",1585876265.0

I'm a 27 M from UK and have a job offer for a company in US.

This is quite stressful to me, my employer suggested possibly the O1A route because I have a PhD and have done some very specific research that is being published, but the requirements for an O1A visa seems difficult and I am still early in my career.

I traveled back to my hometown in India in January. During the visa stamping interview, I was given a 221g, and asked for an end client letter (additional documentation). When following up with my firm, I realized that my end client does not provide such letter (company policy). After researching online and working out with my firm, my attorney has provided me with a contract letter composed by my firm (not end client). This is the best they could do.

I currently could lose my h1 visa and eventually my job. My wife currently is in H1-B visa as well. If things go south, I was wondering if I can apply for h4 visa, travel to stay with my family and eventually find a job with h4+ead.

This is a long process, and I could be unemployed for 2-6 months (if not more). However, the alternative is for me to first search a job in India and then get my wife to leave her job so she can move back to India (huge inconvenience for the missus), and for her to job hunt in India. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Just want to get people's thoughts and figure out the feasibility of the h4+ead option.

1. Looking up online, the wait time for ead for h4 is 30-90 days. Is this accurate (given the news around h4 ead repealing)? 

2. What are the limitations of H4 EAD? I feel it's better than an H1-B as I am not linked with my employer, helps me work for employers that don't need to sponsor me (as per my understanding, my dad validity is tied to my wife's H1 status).",1581614910.0

In the meantime, my employer offered me another position with more responsibilities in their European HQ and I decided to accept, mostly from a professional point of view (I am a EU national so it was easy for me to move back to Europe). It was agreed with my employer that they would not withdraw my H-1B application but that they were not going to spend any more money on it. 

I now recently received a RFE for specialty occupation with deadline to reply on the 9th of February. Both my bachelor and master degrees are in Physics, and I applied with the occupation title of Financial Analyst, so the link between the role and the degree is not straightforward. My job is actually in venture capital, and as it’s at the intersection between tech and finance, it is quite common for people in my field to have a STEM/Technical background. My relevant work experience is almost 3 years. 

The immigration lawyers would like me to pay $1,500 to draft the reply plus $2,000 or more for an expert letter supporting the reply to the RFE. I am now torn as to whether it’s worth paying the fees or not. ***How likely is it I would actually get the Visa? Would it be feasible for me to try to draft the reply myself or would that stand little chance?***

My reasons to have the visa are more an “insurance” in case I wanted to change job and move back to the US, but I haven’t decided yet if I want to move back. My current job could sponsor me for an L-1 but I don’t think this is probable as they want me to stay in Europe for now, and also that wouldn’t allow me to change job. My boyfriend, who moved with me to Europe, is a US citizen so that could also be an option down the line, but I would like to avoid as much as possible getting married for the sake of the VISA. 

I would welcome any of your feedback and ideas, as I have been really struggling to take a decision and time is running out now. Thank you so much for reading my rant!

My employer is confused as he confirms he never come across such RFE and the lawyer is also looking into it. 

I’ve done my search online and asked around and did not find any RFE  ‘after upgrading to premium’ which said quota is full ... does any one here is aware of such RFE , if yes - how did the person reply to it and what was the outcome ?

My sibling and relationship are both in the US so preference would be to try to figure out an alternative way to stay in the country. Should I look into enrolling into a Masters program or something?

IBM H-1B Petitions Hit Hard by Trump Administration Restrictions,3,dsy9nu,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/dsy9nu/ibm_h1b_petitions_hit_hard_by_trump/,5," More good news:

The Trump administration’s attempts to restrict the H-1B program have resulted in a skyrocketing denial rate among companies petitioning for the visa. But which tech companies are impacted the most? Based on data from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), it’s clear that IBM is taking a much bigger hit than tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel.

Denial rates for H-1B petitions have skyrocketed to 24 percent through the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, [according to the NFAP](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/H-1B-Denial-Rates-Analysis-of-FY-2019-Numbers.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-2019.pdf), which attributes the shift to tighter screening by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The agency sent companies additional Requests for Evidence (RFE) in 60 percent of cases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, for example, which is much higher than the traditional 20 percent “historical rate” for RFEs.

These denials hit two categories of H-1B petition: ‘initial employment,’ which means H-1B petitions for new employment, and ‘continuing employment,’ which is typically an extension for an existing employee. Let’s look at a company breakdown for the denial rate for H-1B petitions for initial employment:

What jumps out at you? As we pointed out in another article about this dataset, it’s clear that [H-1B denials are spiking](https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/30/h-1b-denials-spiking-contractor-services/) at subcontracting and business-services firms such as Cognizant. Meanwhile, the denial rate hasn’t risen nearly so much at traditional tech firms such as Google, Apple, and Amazon.

Now check out the company breakdown for the denial rate for H-1B petitions for continuing employment:

Obviously, it’s the same trend here. What’s interesting is that IBM’s skyrocketing denial rates are much more in line with that of a consulting company than a “traditional” tech firm. Of course, IBM offers consulting services in addition to its technology work ([such as quantum computing](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/11/02/ibm-challenges-a-recent-result-in-quantum-computing)), and it’s probably that part of its business that’s smashing headlong into the USCIS buzzsaw.

In addition to a more stringent review-and-denial process for H-1Bs, USCIS has engaged other policies that have slowed down the program over the past two years. The agency recently began asking companies [about the type of work](https://insights.dice.com/2019/07/23/h-1b-visa-companies-must-prove-work/?ads_kw=H-1B) that H-1B visa recipients will be doing, such as vendor agreements, subcontractors, and lists of projects; the heightened rate of RFEs has not only driven [a declining rate of visa approvals](https://insights.dice.com/2019/05/20/h-1b-visa-approvals-declining-despite-critics-claims/?ads_kw=H-1B), but also helped [spark](https://www.dice.com/jobs/q-Spark-jobs) dozens of corporate lawsuits [against the federal government](https://insights.dice.com/2019/03/06/consulting-outsourcing-suing-h-1b-visa/?ads_kw=outsourcing). 

### IBM and H-1B

The [H-1B Salary Database](https://h1bdata.info/), which indexes Labor Condition Application ([LCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application)) disclosure data from the [United States Department of Labor (DOL)](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis), gives us some additional insight into how much IBM pays its H-1B contractors. For this exercise, we isolated for the generic terms “software engineer” and “software developer,” as [our recent analysis](https://insights.dice.com/2019/08/29/ibm-microsoft-oracle-h-1b/?ads_kw=H-1B) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) [dataset](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) of H-1B visa applications for FY2019 found those were the most common terms for H-1B visa hires among tech companies (giving us a more comprehensive view of salary data).

With all that in mind, what did we find out? At IBM, the median salary for H-1B sponsored “software engineer” was $90,106 per year, although that number also varied greatly by city (as you might expect):

A sizable number of IBM’s H-1B applicants, of course, aren’t even reaching this salary stage. It will be interesting to see if the USCIS denial rate continues to rise over the next year.

This is causing me a lot of emotional distress. I don't know what to do. I spoke to HR but they don't have any policy for emotional distress. I am thinking of quitting and looking for a new job that will do an H1B transfer for me. This is in California; employees can quit at any given time. Problem is that as of now, my current work schedule doesn't leave me time to study/prepare or give interviews.

Girlfriend's Student Visa is Expiring while H-1B Transfer is still Processing,6,d8ac7f,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/d8ac7f/girlfriends_student_visa_is_expiring_while_h1b/,6,"Hey all,

As the title says, my girl came to the US on a F1 Student Visa and that is expiring in December. At her previous employer she obtained her H-1B approval. Fast forward like 3 months and her company was bought by a larger company. From what I understand this forced the new employer to redo the entire thing. Apparently the ""amendment"" is to basically fill out all of the paperwork again, with updated employment info, and pay all of the legal fees again as well. They do that. Now fast forward another 3 months or so and we move from MA to NH because I was driving over an hour each way to get to work and she was working from home. This became an issue because she had only started working from home during the last 2 months or so, but her manager told her it was permanent from now on. We didn't think anything of it. AFTER we move we're told that the address on her H-1B paperwork listed her work's office (in MA) as the address of employment and that it couldn't be changed without (once again) paying like $5,000 to resubmit all of the paperwork. All of this to essentially change the address on a piece of paper. Long story short, they refile the paperwork to reflect our home address in NH as the work address.

Here is the current problem: Her F1 Student Visa is expiring and this last H-1B amendment has not yet been approved. The last we heard is that ""it's still processing"". Is she at risk of being deported? What is her official status once the F1 visa expires and the H-1B visa hasn't come back as approved?

Please note that when this whole process started we had no idea about any of this stuff. The laws and processes surrounding these visas are so complicated it's blows my mind. As an American I truly feel disgusted that we make the process this difficult. I have seen first hand how even the H-1B visa pretty much handcuffs you to your employer.

I'm currently working in prop trading industry in Chicago under OPT. My H1b application this year was denied, but I have two more chances with STEM OPT.

I am planning on applying to masters in CS for career change. I would like to learn more about CS and go into tech industry, and also with lower probability of getting accepted as undergrad, I feel like I will be better off to just go to masters as soon as possible and apply in the masters pool. The problem is, most of masters results come out probably after H1b deadline.

Current work culture is a start-up like small team, and I have very good relationship with my employer and coworkers. I like the people, but I don't like the job. So, I wouldn't mind terribly if my H1b application is denied.

So here's the question.

Should I tell my employer that I want to go to grad school?

Should I tell my employer to not apply for H1b since I have already made up my mind to go to masters? Would that be considered rude? I just don't want them to waste $5000+ if I get accepted to grad school.

Brought with me all document required: SSN, DL, Expired EAD, I-797A (valid til 2022), I-797C, I-20 (Cap gap til Sep 30). After reviewing the documents, the DMV representative told me that I am not eligible for a REALID until i receive a new EAD card for H1b, which i told them i won't be receiving, since H1b don't issue new EAD card. 

This got escalated to the field manager then Sacramento office. And they confirmed that i cannot apply for a REAL ID, according to the Federal guidelines, unless i leave the US and get the new VISA stamp.

I travel domestically around 5-10 times a year for both business purpose and leisure. Apparently  from 2020, you can stay in the US to work legally, but in order to travel you have to hog all your ppw to prove that you can do it ( Passport, I-797, I-94), which increase the risk of lost.

**Prevailing Wage:** USCIS wants to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity for the same job. So, your Employer has to prove that the prevailing wage was paid to you (the employee) correctly.

**Job duties:** The job description mentioned in LCA has to match the job title in LCA. Say, for example, if your specialty job title is a generic QA manual tester, the burden of proof is on you to establish that it is a specialty job.

**Right to Control:** If you are working in a remote site away from your (employer or sponsoring entity), then USCIS requires your employer to prove that your daily tasks are being monitored on a daily basis.

**Employer-Employee relationship:** USCIS requires your employer to manage and monitor when you are working at End-client site and ensure that you perform your daily duties.

In essence, always be honest and comply with the system. That is the simple way to get your H1B process going.

Marriage after H1-B denial,3,ckviv3,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/ckviv3/marriage_after_h1b_denial/,3,"Hi everyone,

So I just heard back from USCIS and my H1B was denied. My company is willing to submit an appeal, but in the meantime I would be leaving the country and staying abroad.

My girlfriend (US citizen) and I have been talking about getting married for a while now and planned on doing it next summer - now that my H1B is denied and I have to leave the country, we are considering getting married in the next few weeks. 

Based on what I've read so far, our case should be straight forward (she makes enough, I was never arrested - overstayed visa - worked illegally, history together, families know each other,...) but we are still worried that the fact we are getting married immediately after receiving the denial might raise a red flag, so I would like for your opinion. 

I did some research and it looks like these are the two options I have:

1. File the appeal and get married; stay in the US and be unemployed until I receive my EAD (looks like it would take 4-6 months?). *Downside here is that we'd be living on a single income*
2. Get married and leave the country. Work back home until the marriage gets processed and then come back to the US on a green card. *Downside here is that from my understanding it takes longer to process marriage paperwork when the spouse is not in the US, so we'd have to spend a longer time apart. However, she does have a good PTO policy and remote work at her current job, so there is a chance that she could visit me every few months for longer period of time.*

RFE and Denial Letters - Meltzer Hellrung - HyperScience,10,cd9y14,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/cd9y14/rfe_and_denial_letters_meltzer_hellrung/,4,"I wrote a while back [**about being denied**](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/buesue/denial_by_uscis_for_140k_salary_software_engineer/). I thought I'd share the RFE and denial letters, in case there's anything insightful or useful to be gleaned from it. Perhaps it'll be useful for others to refer to, for their cases.

1. RFE Notice: [https://arjun-menon.com/HyperScience-RFE-Notice-Letter.pdf](https://arjun-menon.com/HyperScience-RFE-Notice-Letter.pdf)
2. RFE Response: [https://arjun-menon.com/HyperScience-RFE-Response-Letter.pdf](https://arjun-menon.com/HyperScience-RFE-Response-Letter.pdf)
3. The Denial: [https://arjun-menon.com/HyperScience-Denial-Letter.pdf](https://arjun-menon.com/HyperScience-Denial-Letter.pdf)

I've only included *the letters themselves*. (Everything else contains private/sensitive information, so can't be shared.) And as far as I can see, in the letters themselves, the only personal information is my name and the petition number, which I'm fine with putting out there.

**A few notes/thoughts**

It took me a month to get a copy of these, so I didn't initially know all of the details behind the denial. (I'm thankful they finally agreed to send me copies of all these documents.) [**Meltzer Hellrung**](https://www.meltzerhellrung.com/) were the lawyers who handled my petition.

Compared to all of my previous jobs' petitions, this one was more thoroughly/extensively documented (when including the RFE response). But it seems like that was not sufficient to convince USCIS that a Software Engineer needs a CS degree. Unfortunately, the lawyers did not go as far as u/bostwickenator's lawyers did [in providing a detailed explanation of job duties and listing team members' degrees](https://old.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bdt5o8/rfe_for_level_4_wage_software_engineer_with_140k/el0iis0/), but is that level of documentation really necessary? All my previous jobs' petitions were approved with the less than the level of documentation that HyperScience provided.

It's possibly really based on who you get as your adjudicator. In the NYTimes article *""*[*Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/immigration-visa-h1b-trump-.html)*""*, the op-ed author (Frida Yu) says: *""My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner.""* — but that wasn't sufficient to convince USCIS that her job needed a degree. According to her article, she got **two** RFEs. So it seems like, in her case, providing profuse evidence only led to a **second** request for evidence. Her petition was probably actually doomed from the very start, based on who her adjudicator was.

I do wish though that the immigration lawyers had provided a more detailed/thorough explanation of my job duties in their response to the RFE. Maybe it would have made a difference. *Who knows?* There was also the fact that HyperScience has a massive contract with the an agency of the federal government — the Social Security Administration (SSA). I think it would've looked very impressive if they'd listed that they had such a huge revenue-generating contract. Also, if they had explained how HyperScience's work improves the lives of people who need [Social Security Disability Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance), maybe the adjudicator would have been less inclined to deny me — considering the significant positive social benefit that the work would provide for American society.

Regarding the point in the USCIS denial letter about HyperScience's office lease terminating on May 31, 2019 — they've now relocated to the 45th floor of the [**One World Trade Center**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center) (a.k.a. Freedom Tower). Dunno why the immigration lawyers didn't mention that the office was relocating to One World Trade Center in the RFE response. I'm sure it would have looked pretty impressive, if they'd done so. But then again, I don't know how this sort of thing is in any way relevant with regard to determining whether a job is a specialty occupation.

The lawyers didn't even expect to get an RFE. I had read online about an uptick in RFEs *for all H-1B petitions*, and I asked the lawyers early on, if they expected one. They said:

>We have not yet been notified of an RFE which is possible but unlikely in your case because of your offered role, degree type and salary. I would anticipate getting an approval by the end of next week at the latest.

After I noticed online (in the case tracker) that my case had gotten an RFE, I asked the lawyers about it, and they said:

>We already reached out to \[*... HR ...*\] as the only documents they requested have to do with HyperScience operations and not about your personal credentials. There is nothing we need on your end and \[*... HR ...*\] is already working on providing us with what is needed. There is no reason to be alarmed as the RFE is what we call a ""stall"" RFE where it seems the USCIS is trying to kick the can down the road regarding the premium processing 15 day clock. We should be able to respond very quickly and get an approval.

So really no one was expecting a denial. Neither the lawyers, nor anyone at HyperScience. Everyone was shocked and in disbelief about the denial.

It's possible that the requirements have changed, and that USCIS today expects an inordinate amount of evidence that shows that the job requires a bachelor's degree. But if such a change in requirements for I-129 petitions has been made, it certainly hasn't gone through [the federal rulemaking process](https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf) (established by the [APA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States))), and the CFR ([Code of Federal Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations)) has not been amended. As far as anyone knows, USCIS hasn't even issued a [Policy Memorandum](https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/policy-memoranda) (PM) about any change in the standard of evidence required for proving a position is a specialty occupation that requires a degree. It's clear that any internal change of requirements with regard to this has been made in violation of [the Administrative Procedures Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States)). But this isn't something new. If you read the news, you'll notice that several actions taken by this administration are being reversed by the courts *solely* for violating the Administrative Procedures Act ([one example](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/justice-roberts-light-rebuke-trumpian-dishonesty/592987/)). With the Constitution and statutory law being ignored and treated [with very little respect today](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/trump-doesnt-care-about-constitution/589654/), I'm not really sure where things are headed. In any case, HyperScience isn't really interested in pursuing my case further. They're not interested in refiling, nor in taking it to court. So there's the [matter of mootness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mootness) — and as a consequence, I can't do anything about this on my own. Refiling the petition was probably the best thing to do, but this whole ordeal was such a bad experience, that they didn't want to deal with it. I can empathize. If I were running a smallish company, and had this experience, I probably would never hire someone on a visa again. Which is probably *precisely* the goal of the people in power.

Anyway, I won't be posting about this anymore. Sorry that this turned into a long post.",1563176150.0

I believe my situation is somewhat unique so I wanted your advice on what to do. I have around $30K in my company 401K (I'm a FTE). I am moving to a contractor role (EC model) in a few weeks, for a big client. My contracting/staffing company doesn't offer an employer match, but they do have a 401K option I believe.

My questions are :

1)  What should I do with my current 401K, especially considering that I plan to leave the US in less than 2 years? My goal would be to ideally take that money with me when I leave in 2021, with minimum loss.

2) Should I contribute to the new 401K as well, considering there's no employer match and I don't see the point in being penalized later for early withdrawal, ie when I leave the US?

Denial by USCIS for $140k Salary Software Engineer Full-time Position (at a real product company; not a consulting/EVM/contracting company),90,buesue,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/buesue/denial_by_uscis_for_140k_salary_software_engineer/,76,"My new job's H-1B visa petition was denied by USCIS ([rfe post](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bdt5o8/rfe_for_level_4_wage_software_engineer_with_140k/)). They essentially said that they were not convinced my new job requires a college degree. This was really surprising and shocking, because my job was not low-paid, and was not with a consulting/outsourcing company. There were many news reports that USCIS was targeting and trying to get rid of people with lower-paying jobs (anything below $100k, or Level 1). The immigration attorneys who prepared my new job's petition had heard the same and didn't expect USCIS to deny my job since it was quite highly-paid. But it seems like the hatred of immigrants has grown so large that they now want to force even well-qualified highly-paid people (who are on visas) out.

My visa sponsoring company's name is [**HyperScience**](https://hyperscience.com/). I have a bachelor's degree in CS from a well-ranked American university. HyperScience is a VC-backed startup that's growing rapidly; and it's a product company, and not a consulting agency ***in any sense***. There are [only two other people](https://www.uscis.gov/h-1b-data-hub?topic_id=Hyper+Labs&state=All&city=&zip=&fy=All&naics=All) on the H-1B visa at HyperScience, so it's not ""*H-1B dependent*"" either. On the Labor Condition Application ([LCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application)), my job was listed with the *SOC Code* [*15-1132*](https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1132.00) *""Software Developers, Applications""*, [for which the Level 4 wage is $138,861 per year](https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?code=15-1132&area=35614&year=19&source=1), **which my base salary of $140,000 exceeds**. ([Here's the official U.S. Department of Labor website link](https://lcr-pjr.doleta.gov/index.cfm?event=ehLCJRExternal.dspCert&doc_id=3&visa_class_id=1&id=6770024) to the LCA that HyperScience filed for me: you can see under section F., a. (which is collapsed by default) that my wage level is marked as ""**IV**"", and my base salary is listed as $140,000.) Beyond the base salary, HyperScience offered other forms of compensation like $60,000 of stock options, $8,400 of 401k match, $2,000 in a [HRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Reimbursement_Account), full zero-premium zero-deductible medical/dental/vision with Aetna + [onemedical](https://www.onemedical.com/), free lunch everyday (through [served by stadium](https://servedbystadium.com/)), free gym membership, etc. Regarding the stock options: I have very high confidence that they'll be successful and grow significantly. If they grow 50%, the stock options are worth $30,000; if they grow 200%, it's worth $120,000. The 401k match, free lunch, etc is conservatively worth at least $15k. So my total compensation is *conservatively* **at least $185,000**.  It's also one of those rare companies with *30 days* *of* *paid time-off* – that's 6 weeks of vacation, on top of federal holidays. They also offered 6 months of ***paid*** parental leave (for any gender). It's rare for any company to be this family-friendly, but it's one of HyperScience's core values — [***see this blog post by the CEO***](https://www.hyperscience.com/blogs/family-values-our-benefits). *All of that is to say*: **I'm not underpaid**.

Besides the core assertion that they were not convinced my job requires a college degree, two other reasons that USCIS gave for the H-1B denial were: first, my job duties was not related to a ""specific project"", and so they were unable to determine if my job has ""*specialty occupation*"" work; and second, a job posting for my position on the HyperScience website did not list a degree (or other educational) requirements. For those wondering what ""*specialty occupation*"" is — it just means a job that requires a bachelor's degree at a minimum. USCIS 's essential claimed was that my job (of *Software Engineer*) does not need a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The spiel about that my ""job duties were not related to a specific project"" is nonsensical, because HyperScience is not a consulting/EVM company. They were ***clearly being disingenuous*** *on purpose*, since they went through the trouble of googling HyperScience, and they likely knew very well that HyperScience is not a consulting company. But they decided to act disingenuous. And, **denying** because ""*it could not be determined*"" is just malignant. HyperScience's immigration lawyers ([**Meltzer Hellrung**](https://www.meltzerhellrung.com/)) said that **the second point was unprecedented**. It's pretty common these days for tech jobs to not mention a degree as an absolute requirement. It seems like the USCIS adjudicating officer was actually malevolently  and impishly hunting for *excuses to deny*. In a diligent prejudiced search for reasons to deny, the USCIS official went on Google, typed in ""HyperScience"", found the [HyperScience Careers](https://www.hyperscience.com/locations/new-york-usa.php) page, and then found  [this job posting](https://jobs.lever.co/hyperscience/aea3d646-5706-4a7a-806c-c78eac2920f2), which matches my title of ""*Software Engineer - Frontend / Fullstack*"" (as listed in the LCA). The job posting unfortunately does not list a bachelor's degree as a necessary qualification. Many tech companies don't. The USCIS official then diabolically ***used*** ***this*** *as a reason to deny*. HyperScience nor its immigration lawyers were expecting them to find a random job posting online, and weaponize it. It's honestly quite unbelievable. It seems like the goal of USCIS today is to just get rid of as many people as possible.

I'm not the one of those underpaid H-1B visa holders that immigrant-haters are always screaming about. I'm well-paid. My work would have improved the lives of Americans with disability in a significant way. (HyperScience is helping the Social Security Administration significantly reduce the processing time for [Disability Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance) applications by automating various aspects of it.)  It's hard to find a job where you can have a positive social impact *in such a direct and tangible way as this*. USCIS denying my H-1B petition actually hurts the [millions of Americans](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table6c7.html) who apply for disability insurance each year. (Helping disabled people get ""on welfare"" is probably the last thing that Republicans care about though.) I came across an article on the NYTimes a while back called [Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/immigration-visa-h1b-trump-.html) — here's a quote from it:

>Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied \[...\]  
>  
>My two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a “specialty occupation” — that is, work that only someone with a bachelor’s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn’t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.

If someone that qualified can get denied, then it's no surprise they want to force me out of the U.S. as well. There obviously is a fair number of people at USCIS who just maliciously *hate immigrants from the depths of their hearts*, and whose daily joy is frivolously denying petitions. They probably laugh with glee every time they ruin the life of well-qualified people who have contributed positively to the U.S. economy for years (or who will do so). They just hate immigrants. ***UPDATE:*** [***See full copies of the letters here***](https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/cd9y14/rfe_and_denial_letters_meltzer_hellrung/)***.*** *Here are a few relevant excerpts:*

I was on L1B in  USA ( Jan 2016 - Dec 2018), my company applied for my H1b in April 2017 and got approved. H1B was approved with consular processing means I had to visit Montreal ( Canada) to activate my H1b. I was laid off, didn't activate my H1b and moved out of USA. Now my question: Can I next US employer use this approved but inactive H1b now (as cap-exempt) OR will they need to start from scratch and apply in April 2020?

Isn't it super unattractive for an employer to hire H1B?,6,bgvya4,h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/bgvya4/isnt_it_super_unattractive_for_an_employer_to/,15,"Hi fellow redditors,

I've been playing with the thought of working in the US for a couple of years.  
There is the option on getting a L1B with my current (German) employer, who is active in the US in several locations, but I am kind of intrigued about trying something entirely different and applying at a different US-based employer, that would require H1B sponsoring.

Am I right that the selection essentially boils down to a single time of the year (beginning of April) at which applications are processed, the visa cap is exceeded, and the window closes again for another year?

Does this mean that - even if I found a company that was willing to sponsor my H1B right away - I would not be able to start working before Autumn 2020?

That sounds awfully restrictive? Who would want to hire a worker thats not available for another one and a half years?

I appreciate your thoughts & opinions",1556148333.0
